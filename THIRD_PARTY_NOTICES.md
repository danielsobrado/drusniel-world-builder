## Low Poly Forest Tree Pack

`public/assets/trees/forest-pack/*.glb`,
`public/assets/rocks/forest-pack/*.glb`, and their offline counterparts are
extracted from “Low Poly Forest Tree Pack” by
[99.Miles](https://sketchfab.com/99.Miles), licensed
[CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
[Source](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/low-poly-forest-tree-pack-5ff5a51e74324845a4e4905f182dfb2)

The source pack is split offline into four grouped trunk/crown trees and nine
grounded rocks. Only curated individual files enter runtime residency; the
showroom layout and background atlas cards are never published as runtime assets.

## Low Poly Tree Scene Free

`public/assets/trees/tree-scene/*.glb` and
`assets/extracted/trees/low-poly-tree-scene/*.glb` are extracted from “Low Poly
Tree Scene Free” by

[Source](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/low-poly-tree-scene-free-89daa5e21f0d4f08a59dba0d566e88bd)

The original 42.8 MB scene is an offline source only. Its 23 tree roots and two
reusable grass shapes are saved individually; repeated grass placements,
showroom ground, and water are not exported.

## Authored Ground Detail

The following models are licensed
[CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). This project groups
their showroom nodes into grounded, instanced prototypes while retaining their

## Authored Wildlife

The optional close-wildlife GLBs are flight-only derivatives of models by
[AnimalMesh 3D](https://sketchfab.com/AnimalMesh3D), licensed
[CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/):

- `public/assets/animals/crow-flight.glb`: “Animated Crow – 3D Animal Model”.
  [Source](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/animated-crow-3d-animal-model-6e634f78d54341a89bbbb6ee1d24876a)
- `public/assets/animals/seagull-flight.glb`: “Seagull – Stylized Animated 3D
  Model”.
  [Source](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/seagull-stylized-animated-3d-model-b331b360c0064536a6e517c1a93a349d)

Changes: unused animation clips are removed, legacy specular/glossiness
materials are converted to metallic/roughness, keyframes are resampled,
textures are runtime-compressed, and model scale, flight paths and habitat
selection are applied by this project. The default distant-flock silhouettes
are generated project geometry and do not reuse the authored meshes or
textures.

## simple-cheap-stylized-tree-shader

`public/assets/textures/leaf/foliage_512a.png` and `foliage_512b.png` are the
`texture/512a.png` and `512b.png` files from
`niceandgoodonline/simple-cheap-stylized-tree-shader-issue-demo`, released under
**CC0 1.0 Universal** (public domain dedication — no attribution required; this
note is a courtesy).

The canopy rim term in `createStylizedLeafMaterial` is ported from the CC0 shader
at `godotshaders.com/shader/stylized-fluffy-tree-leaves`, whose page states the
code is CC0. Only the fresnel formula is taken; the billboard and wind terms are
not used, since this project already has its own vertex wind.

Not used: `TheMIU/Stylized-Fluffy-Tree-Shader`. Its shader descends from the
MIT-licensed original on godotshaders, but the repository carries no licence file
of its own, and the godotshaders MIT explicitly excludes images and assets — so
its leaf textures and Illustrator source are not included here.

## stylized-vegetation

The foliage alpha cards in `public/assets/textures/leaf/` are taken unmodified from:

- Project: `ProblematicToucan/stylized-vegetation`
- Author: Gamal Abdul Aziz
- License: MIT

`leaf_card.png` is that project's `Tree/Leaf.png` and `bush_card.png` is its
`Bush/Bushes.png`. Only the textures are used; the project's Unity shader graphs,
FBX meshes and custom lighting HLSL are not included or derived from.

## Snow007C detail maps

Snow007C by ambientCG (Lennart Demes), CC0 1.0 Universal.
Source: https://ambientcg.com/view?id=Snow007C

Imported from drusniel-gods-end. The original provenance and channel packing
are recorded in `public/assets/textures/snow/manifest.json`.

## Gods’ End visual asset library

The owner’s `drusniel-gods-end` published models, textures and procedural medieval
house recipes are preserved in `public/assets/gods-end/Assets` and
`src/editor/assets/godsEnd/village`. Procedural aquatic plants and seabed boulders
are ported under `src/editor/assets/godsEnd/aquatic` and `seabed`; terrain height
blending and underwater optical algorithms are adapted in the editor's material
and water modules. Cached planar reflection reprojection, angular visibility
envelopes, free-flight controls, foliage KTX2 mip preparation and rendered-pixel
QA are also adapted from the owner's project. Depth-following coastal surf,
crossing ripple trains, spatial ambient calls, shuffle-bag sample variation and
bounded loop-padding trimming are adapted from its water and audio modules.
These audio changes reuse the existing CC0 bank and its per-sample catalogue.
Compiled YAML configuration, correctness lint and double-tap exploration controls
also follow the owner's project. Compressed tree impostor albedos
are derived from the existing attributed tree assets and retain their source
rights. Each published asset import is recorded in
`public/assets/gods-end/manifest.json`. Original attribution, source rights and
texture/geometry provenance are retained in the imported per-folder manifests;
this port does not grant a new license to those assets.

The local Draco decoder and Basis transcoder are redistributed from the installed
Three.js examples. Their upstream licenses remain Apache License 2.0, as covered
by the Draco and Basis Universal notices above.

## Settlement surface textures

Eleven texture sets from Poly Haven (https://polyhaven.com), CC0 1.0 Universal,
reduced to 512 px WebP by `scripts/fetch-settlement-textures.mjs` into
`public/assets/textures/settlement/`: `cobblestone_floor_08`,
`cobblestone_floor_04`, `cobblestone_05`, `stone_tiles_02`,
`patterned_cobblestone_02`, `dirt_floor`, `rough_wood`, `white_plaster_02`,
`rock_boulder_dry`, `grey_roof_tiles_02` and `roof_09`. The last five are stored
desaturated at a fixed brightness, as surfaces the engine tints. The set each
name maps to is recorded in
`src/editor/world/settlements/surfaces/SettlementDressing.js`.

## Procedural Texture Lab runtime

`procedural-texture-lab` (https://github.com/danielsobrado/drusniel-procedural-textures),
Apache License 2.0. Its runtime regenerates the material recipes under
`public/assets/materials/settlement/`, which are exported from the Lab's presets.
