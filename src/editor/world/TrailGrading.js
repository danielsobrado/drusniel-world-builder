 * Walkable roads and trails over the exaggerated relief (after grass-test's

 * and the ground along it is blended toward a profile whose gradient is
 * capped: cut through rises, filled over dips, within limits, with banks
 * that widen where the cut is deep.
 *
 * Routes run for hundreds of kilometres, far too long to trace up front in
 * every worker. A route is split into arcs of `arcMeters`; an arc's profile is
 * traced the first time something asks for a height on it, with its ends
 * pinned to the ground, so the result never depends on which arc was traced
 * first and neighbouring arcs meet exactly.
 *
 * Positions are world cells; widths and heights are metres.
