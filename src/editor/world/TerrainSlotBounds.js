 * Culling bounds for terrain slots.
 *
 * Every slot draws the same flat chunk plane and displaces it by its height
 * texture in the vertex shader. Culled against that flat plane — a sphere a
 * chunk wide around y = 0 — a chunk several hundred metres up the Eldara
 * relief lies outside it, so looking toward the horizon from high ground
 * culled every chunk and only the sky showed where the ground should be.
 *
 * Each slot therefore gets its own geometry object that shares the plane's
 * buffers (no copy) but carries bounds fitted to the heights its page holds.
 * The plane lies in local XY and is displaced along local +Z (the mesh is
 * rotated −90° about X), so the height range is along local Z.
