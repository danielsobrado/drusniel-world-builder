 * and furniture (RoomPlan), and the doorway itself — the dark opening, its
 * frame and the leaf standing open.
 *
 * The pooled house meshes are shells: their walls face outward only and there
 * is nothing inside them. A room is the clear floor measured behind each
 * house's door (SettlementDoors.generated), so it fits inside the shell rather
 * than through it. Rooms differ with every house, so they are not pooled; a
 * whole town's worth is one small static mesh, like its paving.
 *
 * Pure geometry in settlement-local space: x is plan x, z is minus plan z, y is
 * absolute. No three.
