/**
 * The buildings and props a settlement plan may place, as workshop recipes.
 *
 * Each entry is a small, fixed set of variants — the building pool. A town
 * never asks for arbitrary dimensions: it picks a variant index, so a whole
 * world needs at most `styles × entries × variants` distinct meshes, and every
 * placement of one variant shares its geometry. `footprint` is the plot the
 * planner must reserve: the generated mesh's own extent (walls, roof overhang,
 * wings, stairs and sheds) plus a hand's breadth, so terraced plots in a town
 * core stand eave to eave instead of each in its own yard.
 *
 * Pure data, safe in terrain workers.
