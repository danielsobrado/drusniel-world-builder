/**
 * Boulders on the seabed in the shallows (after grass-test's seabed rocks).
 *
 * The donor places these against an authored coastline and its bathymetry: 1.2 to
 * 11 m of water, clustered seaward of the shoreline. Here a coast is just ground
 * standing below sea level, so the band becomes a depth band on the same height
 * samples the beach pebbles use, and the seaward bias becomes a bias toward the
 * shallows.
 *
 * That bias is not only aesthetic. The water is unlit and its colour saturates by
 * about six metres (`docs/plans/grass-test-merge-plan-2026-09-24.md`, P4), so a
 * boulder deeper than that is drawn and never seen. `keep` therefore falls off
 * with depth and the far end of the band is mostly empty — which is why `maxDepth`
 * sits well past the point the stones stop reading.
 *
 * Most chunks are nowhere near water: five height samples reject land before any
 * candidate is tried, and the same probes reject water too deep to show anything.
