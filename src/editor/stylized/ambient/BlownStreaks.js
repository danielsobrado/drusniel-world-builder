/**
 * Wind-blown snow and sand streaming across the ground — after grass-test's
 * `src/weather/blownStreaks.js`.
 *
 * The donor draws it as a 0..1 surface mask: noise stretched `length` metres
 * along the wind and `width` across it, sliding downwind by `travel` metres, cut
 * into gust patches `patch` metres across so the streaming comes and goes, and
 * faded out past `reach` metres where the fine streaks would only shimmer. The
 * material then blends that mask into its own albedo.
 *
 * What is re-derived rather than copied:
 *
 * - *The wind is this project's, not the donor's.* The donor carried a wind
 *   direction uniform and a CPU gust envelope. Here the direction and the gust
 *   come from `sampleWorldWindCanonical`, the same shared field the grass, the
 *   flowers and the trees sway on, so a gust that bends the sward also steepens
 *   the streaks in the same place. No second wind field is created.
 * - *The pattern is measured in canonical world metres*, the space the terrain
 *   material already draws its own noise in (`stylizedFbm(worldXZ…)`) and where
 *   the wind field is sampled, so the streaks are stable across a floating-origin
 *   snap instead of re-rolling with the render origin. The near fade, which is a
 *   difference of two render-space points, stays exact.
 * - *Strength is the ground's give, not one number.* Loose snow lifts readily and
 *   packed sand does not, so each surface carries its own `strength` (how much of
 *   it lifts) and `hardness` (how packed it reads, 0 loose … 1 hard), and the
 *   material may add a per-pixel `packing` node (wet sand, compressed snow) on
 *   top. That is the "ground hardness" the streaks are keyed on.
 *
 * The whole thing is behind `If(amount > ACTIVE)`, and the factory returns
 * `null` when the effect is off, so a world that does not want it pays no nodes
 * at all.
