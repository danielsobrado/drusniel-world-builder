/**
 * Per-grove autumn colour for tree canopies.
 *
 * The leaf material bakes its palette into the material, and one prototype serves
 * a whole species, so autumn cannot be a second set of prototypes without paying
 * for another pair of full-capacity InstancedMeshes per variant. Instead each
 * instance carries a `instanceLeafTint` multiplier, and the tint is keyed on the
 * grove rather than the tree: a stand turns as one, the way the reference art
 * reads, while `colorVariation` keeps per-tree brightness varied inside it.
 *
 * Tints are ratios against the species' own lit crown colour, so `tint * base`
 * lands on the target hue exactly rather than merely darkening toward it. That
 * keeps the material's height gradient and fbm variation intact — the whole
 * canopy shifts hue instead of flattening to one colour.
 *
 * The ratio is anchored on `leafTop` rather than the gradient's midpoint because
 * `leafTop` is the brightest colour the crown reaches. Anchoring there means the
 * target is the crown's ceiling, so no channel is driven past it and the shaded
 * underside stays proportionally darker; anchoring on the midpoint needed
 * multipliers above 4 and blew the top of the gradient out to white.
