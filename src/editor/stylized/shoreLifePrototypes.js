/**
 * The shore-life layer's prototypes — after grass-test's beach scatter, its
 * starfish and its creeping coastal groundcover.
 *
 * One kind per donor feature, each shape coming from `proceduralFlora.js` and its
 * material built here rather than extracted from an asset. The band each one
 * occupies is what matters: `strand` carries its height band and `shoreHabitat`
 * adds the donor's ocean proximity, moisture, clustering and slope restrictions.
 *
 * Each shape is built at its *natural size* — a 12 cm starfish, a 6 cm shell, a
 * 1.6 m twig — and the layer's scale band is then only variation around that,
 * because the ground-detail manifest carries one scale range for a whole layer and
 * not one per prototype. Sizing at build time is also what lets a starfish and a
 * driftwood log share a layer without the log inheriting the starfish's scale.
 *
 * Materials are deliberately plain: a colour, a roughness, and two-sided where the
 * shape is a single surface seen from either side. Nothing here reads the scene,
 * the depth buffer or a viewport texture, so a shore costs no rule at any quality.
