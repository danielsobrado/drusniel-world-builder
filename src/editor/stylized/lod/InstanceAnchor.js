/**
 * Where a scatter view's instance matrices are measured from.
 *
 * Canonical positions on a planet-scale map run to millions of metres, and a
 * float32 matrix steps by a quarter to half a metre there. The GPU applies the
 * instance matrix before the root's, so every vertex of a 10 cm pebble landed
 * on the same step and the stone drew as a sliver; a trunk or a boulder's
 * facets snapped to the same grid. Instances are written relative to this
 * anchor instead — the floating origin as it stood at a rewrite — and the
 * view's root sits at (anchor − origin), so a translation stays within a few
 * kilometres, where float32 resolves well under a millimetre.
 *
 * The anchor moves only once the origin has drifted past `reach`, and only
 * from a rebuild, which rewrites every instance anyway: moving it dirties all
 * of them once, and every other rebuild still uploads only what changed.
