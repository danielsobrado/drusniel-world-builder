 * Water-plant sway, after grass-test's `plantMaterial`.

 * The donor bows every underwater species with the water clock — 0.18 for
 * seagrass, 0.3 for kelp, 0.1 for the algae tufts — and that is most of what makes
 * a bed of the stuff read as alive rather than as a scatter of green cards.
 *
 * Two things make it cheap here. The displacement is a vertex-only expression, so
 * it costs nothing per pixel and nothing to turn off. And the per-instance phase
 * comes free from `instanceDither.y`, the stable seed the lod runtime already
 * writes for every instanced detail, so a bed does not sway in lockstep without a
 * single extra buffer or attribute.
 *
 * The blades are authored one metre tall, so `positionLocal.y` is the height
 * fraction directly: the root stays planted and only the upper part travels, which
 * is what keeps a clump from sliding across the bed as it sways.
