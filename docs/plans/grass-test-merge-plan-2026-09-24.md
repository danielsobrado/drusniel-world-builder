Source project: `F:\Development\grass-test` (three 0.186, WebGPU/TSL, ~44 k LOC in `src/`)
Target project: this repository (three 0.185.1, WebGPU/TSL, streamed Azgaar world)

## 1. Goal

Take what grass-test does well (water, coast, waterfalls, snow, weather, vegetation,
characters, audio, atmosphere) and bring it into SimCity DnD. The game keeps its
foundations:

- unbounded logical world, `64 × 64` pages (2 m cells, so 128 m pages), 49 resident slots,
  macro-far terrain, floating origin;
- Azgaar biome IDs `0–12` as terrain IDs, custom biomes allocated from `32–254`;
- the W0–W4 water domain (`WaterTerrainModel`, streamed `RGBA16F` water field with shore
  distance in A, `RG8` flow field, carved river beds, ocean bathymetry);
- CPU-authoritative heightfield, worker-generated pages, deterministic regeneration;
- `StylizedVariantResidency` for authored assets, and no viewport-texture nodes in
  materials that don't need them;
- SOLID, reasonably small files.

grass-test is a **fixed 2,400 × 1,600 map**: river control points, lake footprint, the cirque
centre, routes, teleports and tree placements are all hand-authored. The main job of this
merge is **turning each authored-coordinate system into one driven by fields**: Azgaar
guidance (biome, elevation, `featureId`, rivers), the streamed water field, and
deterministic per-page hashing in the chunk worker.

## 2. Porting rules (apply to every phase)

1. **Only move code and assets with clear rights.** The README describes grass-test as a *clean-room
   reconstruction of a reference demo* that uses copied reference assets. Do **not** merge
   anything in the "recovered" lineage: `RecoveredGrassMaterial.js`, `LegacyWaterMaterial.js`,
   recovered sky/cloud plane, `terrain2.glb`/`Landscape002`/`Landscape046`, `Samurai-v1.glb`,
   recovered Stone/Lantern props, `tree-world.json`, `world-props.json`, the
   `docs/reference/*` package. Anything we can merge must be one of these:
   - code written in grass-test itself (post-"cinematic" systems): OK;
   - `Noniv/snowflow_demo` ports (MIT, copyright Maksymilian Dendura): OK, and they must be added to
     `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` with the header credits kept;
   - `coastal-jungle` pack (MIT, Codex-and-Blender, own repo): OK;
   - `fantasy`/`fantasy-textures` (user-supplied ChatGPT artwork + repo geometry): OK, but
     `tree1–9` are *derivatives* of reference trees. Treat those as blocked until their
     provenance is confirmed;
   - `Audio/` bank (CC0, OpenGameArt): OK, copy `CATALOG.md` into our licenses;
   - character GLBs (Meshy rigs, user-generated): OK, and ownership was confirmed on 2026-09-24 (§7).
2. **No global rasters.** grass-test bakes a 1536² CPU raster and 2048² GPU height texture for
   the whole map. Here, every field is per page (worker) or camera-local (ring texture),
   never whole-world.
3. **Coordinates.** Shader noise, wave clocks and flow phases use canonical world coordinates
   with the same floating-origin offset contract as `sky.cloudWorldScale`. Anything periodic
   is wrapped (`mod` of tile size) so precision holds at planet scale (Eldara ≈ 16,600 km).
4. **Regional effects are weights, not bounds.** grass-test gates snow country, jungle and coast
   by map regions. Here, those weights come from a camera-local sample of biome ID,
   elevation and shore distance, smoothed over time (e.g. `SnowRegionTracker`).
5. **Authored GLBs stream through `StylizedVariantResidency` and declare `tileIds`.** Never add
   them to a `Promise.all` in `bootstrapLayers`. Scatter views append prototypes and bump
   `prototypeRevision`.
6. **Perf-gate every phase.** Run an A/B `qa:perf` against unmodified `main` at the same
   `--warmup` (see `docs/perf-qa.md`). Do not port grass-test's planar reflections or
   cube-probe re-renders. Our SSR/TAA/post graph stays authoritative.
7. **Three version.** grass-test targets 0.186, and we pinned 0.185.1. Check TSL imports while porting
   (`hash`, `screenCoordinate`, `cameraViewMatrix` exist in both). **Superseded on 2026-09-28:** the
   user asked for the donor's occlusion culling, which is written against r186, and the version was
   therefore bumped to 0.186.1 — see that date's entry in §9 for why the donor's `REVISION` pin turned
   out not to be an API requirement either way, and for the verification performed and still owed.

## 3. Inventory and verdicts

## 4. Shared foundations (Phase 0, blocks everything else)

These four modules are small, and every later phase reads them. Build them first so the ported
systems don't each invent their own copy.

### 4.1 `WorldWindField` (from `weather/WindField.js`)

- New `src/editor/weather/WorldWindField.js` (CPU sampler + uniform bundle) and
  `worldWindNodes.js` (TSL sampler).
- Advect along the **prevailing** direction only. Meander goes in the warp (grass-test's
  documented bug: advecting by local direction makes wind accelerate over time).
- Canonical-world coordinates with floating-origin offset uniform; wrap the time term.
- Response profiles per class: blade, flower, bush, tree canopy, falling leaf, rain, snow,
  cloth (`CharacterWind`).
- Wire `weather_controller` wind X/Z and intensity into it; then migrate
  `StylizedGrassMaterial`, `StylizedTreeMaterials`, rain/snow materials one at a time.
- Acceptance: one gust visibly crosses grass → trees → rain; no drift at t > 30 min;
  `qa:perf` A/B within noise.

### 4.2 `EnvironmentState` (weather accumulators + light snapshot)

- `src/editor/weather/EnvironmentState.js`: rain intensity, surface wetness (exponential
  wet/dry integration), snow cover bias, cloud coverage, time-of-day, moon phase.
- Owned by `weather_controller`; read-only for materials through one uniform group.
- Serialise wetness and wave clock with the session, as grass-test does on recovery.

### 4.3 `RegionalWeights` (camera-local region tracker)

- Samples biome ID / elevation / shore distance / water kind under and around the camera
  (from resident pages, macro atlas fallback) and exposes smoothed weights:
  `snowCountry`, `coast`, `jungle`, `wetland`, `desert`, `underwater`.
- Replaces grass-test's map-bounds gates (`SnowRegionBounds`, `CoastalJungleRegion`).

### 4.4 Licensing and asset intake

- `docs/licenses/grass-test-imports.md`: per-file source, author, licence, date. Update
  `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` (snowflow MIT; Codex-and-Blender MIT; OpenGameArt CC0).
- `scripts/import-grass-test-assets.mjs`: copy only allow-listed files, re-encode
  (Meshopt/KTX2/WebP) with the existing `optimize:runtime-assets`, and write manifests.
- Extend `validate:assets` to fail on any unlisted grass-test file.

## 5. Phases

Ordered by **impact on playability and look ÷ risk**. Each phase is independently shippable.
Effort is a rough guide in focused agent-days.

### 5.1 Phase 1: Characters that feel alive (≈5–7 days)

Why first: the player is on screen 100 % of the time, and the sim already has populations,
adventuring parties and monsters with no bodies.

1. **GLB character runtime** under `src/editor/character/glb/`:
   - `CharacterRoster.js` + `config/characters.yaml` (port the schema: `targetHeight`,
     per-rig clip names, `rootMotion.inPlace`, `clipSpeedInHeights`, `footPlacement`).
   - `GlbCharacterView.js` implementing the same interface as `CharacterView` (`update`,
     `setMotion`, `dispose`), so `PlayerController` picks one or the other. The procedural drow
     stays as a roster entry ("Drow (procedural)").
   - Port `CharacterMotion.js` (mean upper-body idle, ankle measurement), `LocomotionCalibration`,
     `FootstepContacts`.
   - Rescale from posed skinned bounds to `targetHeight` (handles the cm/0.01 vs m rigs).
   - Load through residency: only the chosen player model blocks gameplay, not the first frame.
2. **Grounding:** port `ContactShadow` (terrain-normal blob + per-foot occlusion; uses our
   `getWorldHeight`) and `CharacterOcclusion` (add `characterOcclusionKeep()` to the
   `maskNode` of tree leaves, bushes, tall grass; colour passes only).
3. **Character select:** a loading-screen picker (from `LoadingUi`), `?character=` override
   for QA, and persistence in settings.
4. **Footstep event bus:** `FootstepContacts` emits `{foot, position, speed, surface}` that
   audio, trampling, snow/sand prints and water ripples subscribe to (§5.4, §5.5, §5.7).

Acceptance: no foot sliding at walk/run in QA capture; idle arms hang naturally; the player stays
visible through canopy; `CharacterView` perf unchanged when the drow is selected.

### 5.2 Phase 2: Rivers with waterfalls (≈5–6 days)

1. **Fall detection:** `water/RiverFalls.js` runs `findRiverFalls` over each river's
   segment levels in `createRiverSurfaceSegments`: slope > 0.35, drop ≥ 3 m, peak > 0.6.
   Relief is exaggerated 48×, so add a `maxFallsPerRiver` cap and a minimum spacing, and tune the
   thresholds in `editor.config.yaml` (`water.falls.*`). Falls are deterministic from the import,
   so no persistence change is needed.
2. **Field encoding:** extend the worker water field with a fall/cascade weight and travel
   time. Prefer packing into the existing flow texture (RG8 → RGBA8: B = fall weight,
   A = travel-time phase) over adding a new texture/vertex attribute (see the 9-attribute
   ceiling memory).
3. **Shading:** port `waterfallTexture.js` and the fall/plunge branch into
   `StylizedWaterMaterial`: strands stretched along the fall, speed rising 1.4 → 6.5 m/s, bank
   fraying, impact churn decaying downstream, reflections reduced on cascades. The branch
   only runs where fall weight > 0.
4. **Geometry:** a river-segment surface already follows the slope. Check that steep
   segments get enough vertices, or add a cascade ribbon mesh per fall generated in the worker.
5. **Mist:** port `WaterfallMist` as a pooled instanced system. Each resident page contributes
   its falls, and the pool is capped with a 650 m draw distance and quality shares 0.35/0.6/0.85/1.
   Lighting reads the sky's sun/hemisphere (no new lights).
6. **Rocks:** add a `riverbank` placement mode to `StylizedRockView`: bank stones clustered
   with bare gaps, lip boulders, tumbled plunge-pool blocks, settling toward the low side.
   Stones skip fall zones but keep their random draws (stable placement).
7. **Mouth handover:** blend river → ocean kind over the last 2.5 m of fall and sink
   near-sea apron ground 0.35 m (shoal) in `WaterTerrainModel`, so estuaries don't end in a sand bar.

Acceptance: the tallest fall in Eldara reads as falling water from 300 m; mist ≤ 0.1 ms GPU
up close; no chunk-border seams in fall shading; hitch count A/B unchanged.

### 5.3 Phase 3: Lakes (≈4–6 days; requires a decision)

W4 deliberately deferred lakes, because stable lakes change geography and persistence.
Azgaar exports lakes as features (`pack.features[type=lake]` with height and a cell list),
and we already persist a `featureId` guidance field.

- Decision needed: **water-domain version 3**, which adds lake body IDs and per-body surface
  elevation from Azgaar lake features. Per CLAUDE.md there's no legacy migration, so worlds are
  re-imported.
- `WaterTerrainModel`: carve the lake basin below the body level, clamp inflow/outflow river
  levels to the lake level (grass-test's `outletStartIndex` logic), and add a river-ownership
  mask so lake and river don't double-draw.
- Port `LakeFlora` species into `AquaticPlacement` (rooted: eelgrass, waterweed, pondweed;
  floating: lily pads riding the broad wave).
- Lake audio bed and shoreline footsteps come from Phase 7.

### 5.4 Phase 4: Coast, beach and deep sea (≈6–8 days)

1. **CoastField adapter** (`water/CoastSurfaceNodes.js` + CPU twin): signed shore distance
   (field A) plus a wave phase give run-up front, thin-water coverage, foam front, wash
   memory and permanent moisture. The shared `seaCoverage` ramp (0.015–0.15 m mean depth)
   hands off between the sea and ground materials.
2. **Wet sand in the terrain material** for sand-bearing cells (shore band of any biome,
   desert 1/2 coasts): film, reflective wet → damp → dry. Rain raises moisture from
   `EnvironmentState`.
3. **Sea swell:** apply five zero-mean directional components (λ 56/38/28/20/16 m,
   amp 1.6, storm × 1.65) as vertex displacement on ocean water slots only. Scale by
   `smoothstep` of bathymetry depth so the waterline stays put, and inflate slot bounds by the max
   displacement. Normals come from a mipmapped slope texture with a second moment (specular
   broadens with distance instead of aliasing).
4. **Whitecaps and crest transmission** in the ocean branch.
5. **Deep sea:** depth-driven absorption and colour from bathymetry (already 24 m max; allow a
   deeper `abyss` band for open ocean); swell amplitude grows with depth. Port the
   `UnderwaterPerformanceController` idea: drop grass, ground detail and far scatter while
   submerged.
6. **Rain ripples** on all water (cell-ring normal) gated by rain intensity.
7. **Beach scatter:** `BeachScatter` (pebbles, shells, twigs) and starfish in the swash band,
   `CoastalGroundcover` creeping leaves 55–145 m inland. Both are scatter layers keyed on shore
   distance and biome, with no collision and no shadows.
8. **Sand footprints and kicked sand** reuse the Phase 5 deformation field and powder pool.

Acceptance: sea meets the beach with moving swash and a drying wet band; no T-junction seams
between slots; the sea draw is ≤ its current cost +10 % at "high"; the stated
viewport-texture rule holds (medium keeps no copied depth).

### 5.5 Phase 5: Snow country (≈7–9 days)

1. **Accumulation model** (CPU + TSL twins, like grass-test's `snowSlopePatchCpu`):
   elevation band, slope start/full with slope-patch noise, wind-exposure/lee
   (`snowAccumulationShift` from aspect × prevailing wind from `WorldWindField`),
   concavity, and glacier (11) / tundra (10) biome bias. Replaces the `snowLine`/`snowSlopeMax`
   classification in `TerrainMaterialBake*`. The CPU twin gates grass, flowers and broadleaf trees
   (nothing grows through lying snow).
2. **Snow shading nodes** (snowflow port): sastrugi, multi-scale detail, blue
   backscatter, grazing glints, rock tint under the band, water-ice on steep faces, packed
   snow on paths.
3. **Deformation:** `SnowDeformationField` as a player-centred scrolling RGBA8 texture
   (depression, berm, gradient XZ). Painted from footstep events, read through
   `createDeformationNodes` by snow and sand. NPCs near the camera paint too.
4. **Powder:** `SnowPowderSystem` for footfall kicks and ambient spindrift (snow only).
5. **Snowfall:** replace `snow_system.js` flakes with the `SnowfallSystem` material (hash
   phases, wind-coupled), keeping `weather_controller`'s API and the WebGL fallback.
6. **Snow atmosphere:** `SnowAtmosphere` blends the active sky toward a low warm sun, cool
   sky and haze by the `snowCountry` weight, relative to the preset (a moonlit summit stays
   moonlit).
7. **Valley fog** (quality ≥ high, `snowCountry` > 0.001): height-marched mist sampling the
   macro/near height. **Perf risk:** A/B it alone; if it costs more than 0.5 ms, move it to
   a half-res post node.
8. **Mountain relief (optional, terrain change):** `MountainNoise` ridged multifractal (3
   octaves; drop octaves finer than 2 cells) in `AzgaarMacroWorldGenerator` local relief for
   high cells. Adds couloirs and crest notches where slope and elevation qualify. This changes
   terrain generation, so follow `docs/perf-qa.md`. The world must be re-imported.
9. **Alpine trees:** snow spruce and windswept pine (`tree10/11`, repo geometry + user bark) as
   residency variants for taiga (9) and tundra (10) edges.
10. **Deep-snow wake** (`SnowSurfWake`), later, after footprints ship.

### 5.6 Phase 6: NPCs and crowds — **dropped (2026-09-27)**

Dropped by decision, along with the giant serpents of §10. The sim still has
settlements, population, factions, combat and adventuring parties with no visual
presentation, and that is now accepted rather than planned: none of this phase is
being built, so nothing below is a target.

What was assessed, for the record, in case it is ever picked up again: the donor's
`NpcSystem` pattern is wander targets, clip cross-fades and a turn rate, pulled from
sim queries near the camera and assigned archetypes by settlement culture, faction and
role. It would have needed a crowd LOD the donor does not have — full skinned mesh
with per-character mixers inside ~30 m, a shared mixer per archetype and clip with
phase offsets out to ~120 m, a baked vertex-animation texture instanced per archetype
to ~300 m, and nothing or a map dot beyond — plus frustum and distance culling wired
into the perf counters.

### 5.7 Phase 7: Weather, time of day, atmosphere (≈4–5 days)

- **Presets as time × weather:** port the seven environment presets into
  `StylizedSkyView` palette sets (Highfield day, Emberfall golden hour, Greyrain overcast
  rain, Galewind windy, Stillmeadow calm, Lowsway low-sun, Moonrise night). Weather modes
  stay orthogonal: `weather_controller` picks the sky preset and wind/rain from mode + time.
- **Wetness:** ground darkening and roughness drop from `EnvironmentState.wetness` in the terrain,
  rock, building and character materials (grass-test tags meshes with rain-roughness metadata).
  Buildings get it through the workshop materials. Check that the workshop preview and world
  still agree.
- **Cloud shadows:** port `cloudShadow.js`, with offset from the sky cloud drift in world space
  (floating-origin safe).
- **Falling leaves:** `LeafSystem` near deciduous canopies (biomes 6/8, autumn tint in
  golden hour).
- **Grade tuning:** apply the look-pass ideas (lift/gain, highlight desaturation, grain)
  as `PostProcessingPresets` values, not a new pass.
- **Iris transition** (optional) for preset/teleport hard cuts.

### 5.8 Phase 8: Vegetation and biome kits (≈6–8 days)

- **Tropical kit:** the coastal-jungle v2 objects (palms, broadleaf, ferns, vines, climbers,
  split-leaf, banana understory, background trees + LOD) become residency layers with
  `tileIds` for tropical seasonal forest (5) and tropical rainforest (7), plus palm-only
  coastal edges for savanna (3) and hot desert (1) oases. Meshopt decoding is required. Species go
  into `ForestSpeciesRegistry` so impostor baking covers them (`bake:impostors`).
- **Grass silhouettes per biome:** done 2026-09-27. `slender`, `reed` and `broadleaf`
  are ported as generated profiles (`grassBladeProfiles.js`), because the donor's
  fourth family, `tufted`, is a billboard shape and this project's near band is a
  blade strip. `stylizedSurface.grass.bladeProfiles.biomeSets` gives a biome a set,
  chosen per chunk by the majority biome it stands on. Wetland gets reeds, grassland
  a slender/broadleaf mix, the forest biomes a narrower blade.
- **Trampling:** port `InteractionMap` as a player-centred scrolling texture read by
  `StylizedGrassMaterial` (bend + slow recovery), painted by footstep events. Still
  open: today the field reads the shared snow/sand footprint deformation
  (`groundDeformationNode`) for trampling and a static rock-influence texture for
  boulders, which covers the footprint case but not crush direction or recovery.
- **Trails:** take `LandscapePaths`' walkable grading (forward/backward max-grade
  profile, blend within `terrainWidth`, terraced `cut` gorges) and apply it to Azgaar routes
  (roads/trails) in the chunk worker. Walkable roads over the exaggerated relief matter for
  playability. This is a terrain-generation change, so it goes through the perf QA protocol.

### 5.9 Phase 9: Audio (≈3–4 days)

- Import the CC0 bank (≈1.8 MB, mp3). Map files to `audio_events_defaults.json` IDs. The
  procedural synth stays as fallback and for events without samples.
- Surface-classified footsteps (grass, dirt, sand, snow, stone, wood, shallow/deep water)
  from `FootstepContacts` + terrain/water sample + snow/sand coverage.
- Ambient beds weighted by `RegionalWeights` (forest, wetland, lake, coast, highfield
  wind) × weather (rain light/medium/heavy) × time (crickets at night, birds by day).
- Random 3D emitters (birds, crows, frogs, insects) around the listener, gated by biome/time.
- Waterfall roar positioned at falls from Phase 2.

## 6. Recommended order and milestones

```text
P0 foundations ──► P1 characters
       │
       ├──► P2 waterfalls ──► P3 lakes (decision)
       ├──► P4 coast & sea
       ├──► P5 snow ──► (P8 trails/relief share the terrain-change QA window)
       ├──► P7 weather/time/atmosphere
       └──► P9 audio (can start any time after P1's footstep bus)
```

- **Milestone A, "walk the world":** P0 + P1 + P9 footsteps. You pick a hero, they're grounded
  and audible.
- **Milestone B, "water you remember":** P2 + P4 (+ P3 if approved).
- **Milestone C, "seasons of Eldara":** P5 + P7 + P8.
- ~~**Milestone D, "living towns":** P6.~~ Dropped 2026-09-27 with the NPC phase.

## 7. Decisions (resolved 2026-09-24)

1. **Lakes (P3): approved.** Water-domain v3 carries lake body IDs and per-body surface
   elevation from Azgaar lake features. Worlds are re-imported. No legacy migration.
2. **Terrain-shape changes: approved as one window.** P5.8 (ridged relief) and P8 (graded
   trails) ship together behind a single generator-version bump and one re-import.
3. **Asset rights:** the user confirms that all eight character GLBs are theirs, generated with
   Meshy. They are cleared for import. Open point: grass-test's own records
   (`docs/tree-system.md`, `fantasy/manifest.json`) describe `fantasy/tree1–9` as derived
   from the reference demo's `terrain2.glb` (`Tree1_High`…), not from Meshy. Those nine stay
   out until that provenance is reconciled. `tree10/11` are original procedural geometry with
   user bark and are cleared.
4. **Hero character: Drusniel.** The default player is `Drusniel_Dark_Elf.glb`. The
   procedural drow stays selectable (`character.hero: drow`). Started 2026-09-24. See §9.
5. **Medieval houses:** skipped in favour of the workshop system.

## 8. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Waterfall count explodes with 48× relief | Thresholds + per-river cap + min spacing in config; count reported in perf counters |
| Skinned crowds CPU-bound | VAT tier + throttled shared mixers; hard cap on full-rig NPCs |
| Valley fog / snow shading GPU cost | Quality-gated, region-weighted; A/B each piece alone |
| Vertex attribute ceiling (9th attribute makes mesh vanish) | Pack into vec4s / existing flow texture |
| Float precision at planet scale in waves and noise | Canonical coords + floating-origin offset uniforms + wrapped phases |
| three 0.185.1 vs 0.186 TSL differences | Compile-check each ported node file; no version bump |
| Licensing contamination from recovered lineage | Allow-list import script + `validate:assets` gate |
| Workshop/world tone mismatch after grade and wetness | Shared tone-mapping settings; verify in both views |

## 10. Addendum: grass-test commits of 2026-09-22 to 2026-09-25

grass-test kept moving after this plan was written. Reviewed through `05ba54c`, the
same rules apply (§2): clear rights only, and the recovered-reference lineage stays
out.

| Area (grass-test) | What it adds | Verdict | Target here |
|---|---|---|---|
| Audio bank v2 (`3f8c12a`, `93ed089`, `scripts/build-audio.mjs`) | The bank is rebuilt from CC0 and public-domain recordings, with `CATALOG.md` giving every source and licence. New: snow and sand footsteps, alpine and meadow wind, sea surf, stream, jungle day and night, night crickets, and one-shots (meadow birds, crows, seagulls, waves, frogs, cicadas, parrots, screaming piha). The old bank is deleted | **Port, replacing our copy of v1** | `public/audio/cc0`, the audio events, `AmbientSoundscape` regions (snow, sand, surf, jungle, water) |
| Ambient effects (`5a02d7b`, `d6e9d6b`) | Per-region GPU particle fields: diamond dust, spindrift, pollen, dandelion seeds, fireflies at night, blowing sand, surf spray, jungle spores, midges. Also the player's breath, spindrift plumes off crests, and blown streaks on snow and sand. Frost, heat shimmer and jungle mist in the post pass | **Port** particles, breath, plumes and streaks. Frost is ported in the grade. Heat shimmer and jungle mist read the scene or depth, so they need an A/B first (CLAUDE.md viewport-texture rule) | new `stylized/ambient/`, regions from `sampleTilesAround`, `SnowCountryWeight` and water queries |
| Surface detail (`83cdfa3`, `d6e9d6b`, `3ff00ed`) | Rock streaks, strata, curvature crevices, ledge snow; height-blend transitions; scree; beach strand stones; wet waterline and algae; bark weathering (moss, streaks, snow); straw fringe at path edges; tree and rock contact shade | **Adapt** bark weathering to the tree materials and rock weathering to the rock view. Terrain terms have to fit the baked material and its texture budget | tree and rock materials; `TerrainMaterialBakedNodes` |
| Beach and water life (`833a420`, `624b36a`, `3f8c12a`) | Starfish, seabed rocks, sea algae, lake flora, river details, beach palms, a strand-line scatter | **Port** the procedural pieces as stone-sink and scatter layers. Palms follow the tropical kit (P8) | `coastStones` pattern, water slots |
| Giant serpents (`b755559`, `05ba54c`) | Procedural giant snakes: species, a worker-baked skin, and a body that follows its path | **Port** as wildlife in jungle and wetland | new `stylized/wildlife/serpents/` |
| NPCs (`7cd863f`, `9c56206`, `09a07d2`, `41507c7`, `e502ff2`) | NPC kinds (villager, goblin), village farmers, per-camera culling, minimap markers | **Fold into P6** with its crowd LOD | `NpcPresentationView` |
| Assisted camera follow (`f149f95`, `d06e528`) | Camera follows the heading unless you look around (touch only) | **Skip**: desktop input | — |
| Loading and draw-call work (`e502ff2`, `1b08080`, `2ec9162`, `93fd222`, `2193353`) | Scene preprocessing, asset load context, **one grass batch per LOD**, per-variant low-LOD tree shadows, resolution-independent tree LOD | **Ideas only**: our streaming and residency differ. Revisit tree shadow casters under perf QA. Assessed 2026-09-27: the one-batch-per-LOD trick stays out — it exists to stop a camera turn rebuilding a batch, and this project's chunks are already per-slot resident with a band swap that shares instance buffers, so there is nothing to rebuild | — |
| Grass density and blinking-strip fix (`a42791c`) | Lives in `RecoveredGrassMaterial` | **Excluded** (recovered lineage) | — |
| Character occlusion smoothstep fix (`5501d02`) | Reversed smoothstep | **Already fixed here** | — |

Order: audio v2 (done), ambient effects (done), then beach and water life,
surface detail, and the rest of §11. The serpents and the NPCs that followed
them in this list are dropped — see §5.6 and §11.

## 11. Re-scope: what is left, and the performance filter (2026-09-27)

The scope of this merge is now **every technique in grass-test that works well and is
already cheap**. Two areas are dropped by decision and are no longer targets: the
**NPC crowds** (P6, §5.6) and the **giant serpents** (§10). Everything else in §3 and
§10 that is not already logged as done in §9 is still to do.

The filter, which §3 already applies area by area and which decides every remaining
call: take it if it costs a shader or a bounded per-frame update, leave it if it
re-renders the scene, reads the viewport depth buffer where it can be avoided, uses a
planar reflection or a cube probe, or iterates the whole map. This project's SSR/TAA
post graph stays authoritative, and terrain materials keep to the documented
viewport-texture rule.

### Still to do, in order

| # | Area | Donor source | Target here |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Beach and water life | `world/BeachScatter.js`, `world/BeachStarfish.js`, `world/CoastalGroundcover.js`, `water/SeabedRocks.js`, `water/SeaAlgae.js`, `water/LakeFlora.js`, `water/RiverDetails.js`, `world/BeachPalms.js` | scatter/stone-sink layers keyed on the water field's shore distance, in the `coastStones` pattern |
| 2 | Surface detail | rock streaks/strata/crevices/ledge snow, bark weathering, waterline algae, straw fringe, contact shade | `StylizedRockView`, tree materials, and the baked terrain terms |
| 3 | Deep water | bathymetry-driven absorption and colour, offshore whitecaps, crest transmission, `UnderwaterPerformanceController` | the ocean branch of `StylizedWaterMaterial`, plus a submerged-quality policy |
| 4 | Tropical kit | coastal-jungle v2 objects | residency layers for biomes 5 and 7, palm-only edges for 3 and 1 |
| 5 | Trampling | `grass/InteractionMap.js` | a persistent grass disturbance field read by `StylizedGrassMaterial` |
| 6 | Alpine trees | `tree10/11` | taiga and tundra residency variants, after an offline extract |
| 7 | Valley fog | `valleyFog.js` | quality-gated, region-weighted gorge mist |
| 8 | Deep-snow wake | `SnowSurfWake` / `snowWakeSpine` | on top of the footprint deformation field |
| 9 | Ambient tail | blown snow and sand streaks, grass gust sheen, frost | the existing `stylized/ambient/` layer |
| 10 | Heat shimmer, jungle mist | read the scene or depth | A/B each alone before it lands |
| 11 | Couloirs, crest notches | `MountainNoise` detail | `world/MountainRidges.js`; terrain change, so re-import and `docs/perf-qa.md` |
| 12 | Day/night, stars, moon | donor has presets only | the P7 tail: an animated cycle, stars, a moon disc distinct from the sun |

Item 1's donor report is already gathered; items 2–12 are inventoried as they are
started rather than up front, because the donor's fixed-map assumptions mean each one
has to be re-derived against a field before it is worth writing down.

### Open from the grass pass

The browser A/B for the two-band LOD, the resumable build and the density coverage
(`docs/perf-qa.md`, "Grass two-band LOD and density coverage"): the numbers there are
reasoned, not measured, because this pass had no GPU machine.

## 9. Implementation log

- **2026-09-24, Drusniel hero (P1 core).** Meshy source decoded from Draco into
  `assets/characters/`, prepared by `scripts/prepare-character-assets.mjs`, and published
  through the gltfpack pipeline. The runtime is `src/editor/character/glb/`: roster
  resolution, in-place root-motion calibration, distance-driven walk/run phase (the drow's
  no-slide rule), a generated standing pose, foot placement on slopes, a procedural cast
  pose, and it relies on the 0.5 m first-person near plane (as the drow did) to
  clip the head. It is chosen by `character.hero` in `editor.config.yaml`.
  - Asset: 31,077 triangles and 28 joints. Walking and Running are kept and `restpose` is
    dropped. Published at 859 KiB (Meshopt + KTX2), passing `validate:runtime-assets` and
    `validate:character-assets`.
  - Verified in the running app (WebGPU): it loads after the first frame and compiles
    before its first draw. The 9 m/s walk plays the run clip at 2.03×, the 16.2 m/s sprint
    caps at 3.2×, and the body faces its direction of travel. Feet sit at ground +
    measured ankle height, including on a 14° slope. The cast raises the leading arm.
    Frames were captured standing, running side-on and casting.
  - Cost: the `character` perf phase averages 0.09–0.11 ms of CPU per frame (p95 0.2 ms).
    A whole-frame A/B against `hero: drow` could not be completed on the
    2026-09-24 machine state: the drow side timed out at boot, because its prewarm
    recompiles the whole scene. Repeat it with `--warmup 20` on a quiet machine.
  - Still open in P1: the character-select screen, contact shadow, foliage dither around
    the player and the footstep event bus.
- **2026-09-24, swimming.** No roster rig ships a swim clip, so the swim is posed
  procedurally over the standing pose. `SwimMotion` computes the swim weight, the
  tread↔stroke blend, body pitch along the direction of travel (capped at 1.3 rad at the
  surface so the head stays out, up to 2.6 rad head-down when diving) and the stroke
  phases. `SwimStroke` solves the hands and feet onto front-crawl, flutter-kick,
  sculling and eggbeater paths in the body's own frame, using the shared two-bone reach.
  The body pitches about a chest-height pivot, which sits just below the surface at the
  float depth. Verified in the running app on open sea: treading shows head and shoulders
  out, the crawl lies flat along the surface, and the dive runs head-down.
- **2026-09-24, rest of the characters phase.**
  - *Roster:* all eight Meshy characters were imported (Drusniel, Enanillo, Paladin,
    Cleric, Wizard, Serpent Master, Villager, Goblin). The rig contract ignores the
    `mixamorig:` prefix, so the Villager and Goblin rigs work too. Older exports without
    a metal/roughness map are made dielectric at prepare time, because glTF's default
    factors are fully metallic and render black without an environment map. Swimming
    lifts every body to the same chest depth, so short heroes keep their heads out.
  - *Character select:* a topbar picker (`HeroSelectUi`) drives `SwitchableCharacterView`.
    The current hero stays on screen until the new one has loaded and compiled, a failed
    load keeps the current hero, and a newer pick supersedes a pending one. The choice is
    saved per viewer, and `?hero=` overrides it.
  - *Contact shadow:* a soft blob under the body and a patch under each sole lie on the
    terrain slope and fade as the body or a foot leaves the ground. It is hidden while
    swimming. `character.contactShadow` switches it off.
  - *Footsteps:* `FootstepTracker` fires when the shared stride phase crosses each foot's
    measured landing. Footfalls reach listeners across hero swaps, and play the
    procedural `player.footstep` sound, or `player.footstep.water` when wading.
  - *Canopy cut:* tree-leaf materials dither open in a window around the third-person
    hero (`CharacterOcclusion`), for leaves only, because the shadow pass falls back to
    `maskNode`. The uniforms were verified live. A pixel capture of the cut was not
    obtained.
  - *Verified in the app:* the goblin with its contact shadow, and a live swap to the
    Paladin.
  - *Open:* one capture right after the first Paladin swap showed a red wedge where his
    shield should be. It did not reproduce in a second swap, and CPU skinning of that
    asset is clean. Watch for it.
- **2026-09-24, shared wind field (P0, §4.1).** `WorldWindPass` evaluates the gust field
  once per frame into a camera-centred 128² half-float target (384 m, texel-snapped in
  canonical space, lattice wrapped mod 1024, integer hash so CPU and GPU agree to ~3e-5).
  Grass and flowers sample it for sway direction and gust strength. Trees are not wired
  yet: their `positionNode` has no per-tree world position to sample with.
- **2026-09-24, water domain v3: falls and lakes (P2 + P3).** Worlds must be re-imported.
  - *River levels and falls:* Azgaar river points sit about 100 km apart. A straight
    surface between them floated over the valleys in between: 21 % of Eldara's river
    length was more than 2 m above the ground, and up to 411 m. Levels are now traced
    along the terrain every `river.profileStepMeters` (100 m) as a running minimum, and
    a lake a river runs through caps its level (`RiverReachProfile`). Now 1.2 % floats,
    by at most 5 m. Where the trace drops at least `falls.minimumHeight` within one step,
    that drop becomes a waterfall, split into a cascade above `maximumHeight`. The
    carved bed follows the falls, so each face is a real cliff. On Eldara that gives 721
    falls on 57 reaches, median 5 m and at most 22 m. Building the traced profile adds
    no measurable time. `RiverChannel` now indexes only the blocks its channel crosses.
    The old bounding-box enumeration overflowed a `Map` on Eldara.
  - *Gorges (2026-09-25):* where an Azgaar path crosses a ridge, the river used to cut a
    slot only as wide as its channel. 11 % of river length ran more than 50 m below the
    ground. `RiverValley` now holds the ground beside every channel under a slope ceiling
    (`river.valleySlope`, 0.7). Its reach follows the cut on the centre line (up to
    `valleyReachMeters`), so walls climb all the way out before the terrain takes over. A
    levee (`leveeHeight`, `leveeWidthMeters`) keeps low ground beside the channel above the
    water. Lakes and valleys share `BankProfile`. On Eldara the deepest gorges (≈630 m)
    now have walls of exactly 0.7, where the worst slope used to be 3.7. The coarse 512 m
    valley index holds 495 k keys, and model build time is unchanged.
  - *Lakes:* Azgaar stores lakes as low marine cells, which rasterized as sea-level pits.
    The import now rasterizes lake cells as land at the lake's level, in the biome around
    them (`AzgaarLakes`), and keeps each lake's height and outline. `LakeBodies`:
    - fills each lake at the level its Azgaar height maps to (Eldara: 0.3–54 m), with
      noise applied to the shoreline;
    - carves a bed up to 18 m deep and raises a 1.5 m bank so a lake cannot spill;
    - holds nearby hills to `shoreSlope` (0.3). Azgaar outlines follow cells, not the
      terrain's dip, so without this the shores were cliffs up to 300 m high.

    Rivers entering a lake run at its level. Lake cells report the water tile, so
    tile-driven water and far terrain show them.
  - *Look:* the flow texture is now RGBA: current, fall weight, plunge weight.
    `WaterfallShading` streaks a strand texture ported from grass-test down each face and
    churns the plunge pool. `WaterfallMist` gives grass-test's GPU spray puffs to the six
    nearest falls within 650 m, in floating-origin space.
    `stylizedSurface.water.waterfall` tunes both, and neither is drawn at water qualities
    without foam.
  - *Import fix:* a fresh Azgaar import never recorded its water domain, so the loader
    refused it ("version 0 requires migration"). This happened before this work too. The
    importer now stamps the active domain.
  - *Lake inflow:* where a river still stands above a lake's level, the river owns the
    water, so a fall at the shore runs down into the lake unbroken.
  - *Verified in the app* (a private Chromium on Eldara, re-imported):
    - A 15.5 m fall on open river shows its whitewater face across the channel, with
      spray at its foot. Six mist slots were live, four of them in view.
    - The flow textures around it carry the fall and plunge weights: 1,159 fall texels
      and 7,090 plunge texels.
    - Albromer lake shows from its bank.
    - No scene geometry had non-finite positions.
  - *Found in passing:* the flower cross geometry was missing one position value
    (23 instead of 24). That skewed every flower's second plane and made three.js log
    NaN bounding spheres. Fixed.
- **2026-09-25, trees: morphology and world wind.** The compiled WGSL showed that three
  r185 applies the instance matrix before a material's `positionNode`. So the per-tree
  crown and trunk scale, written for prototype space, acted in mesh space, and pulled
  crowns up to 156 m away from their trunks. On screen, near trees stood as bare
  branches. `setPreInstancePosition` now runs the morphology before instancing. The leaf
  wind and canopy colour gradient read the prototype height (`positionGeometry`), where
  they had read world height and saturated. Trees and tree proxies now take sway
  direction and gusts from the shared world wind field, with no extra vertex buffer.
  Verified in the app: identity against real morphology on the same tree, and a stand
  with crowns in place. A young or dead tree legitimately shows a small crown under bare
  branch tips; that is `treeMorphology`'s design, visible for the first time.
- **2026-09-25, P2/P3 closed out.**
  - *Riverbank rocks:* `buildRiverbankRocks` adds stones to the rock view's manifests
    (`rocks.riverbank`). Bank runs are clustered with bare gaps and skip fall faces;
    boulders sit across each fall's lip and tumbled blocks in its plunge pool. They
    draw, fade, collide and block trees like any boulder. Each stone is owned by the
    chunk its own position lies in, because collision refuses a collider outside its
    owner chunk (the first cut tripped that, and it is fixed). At the 15.5 m test fall:
    141 bank stones, 42 lip boulders and 73 plunge blocks nearby, with no collision
    errors.
  - *Mouth handover:* not needed. A river reaches the sea at sea level, and river
    samples win inside the channel, so the river sheet meets the ocean sheet at the
    same height. The levee is off where the level is at sea level.
  - *Lake flora:* already covered. `AquaticPlacement`'s rooted and floating rules
    include the lake kind, so lakes get aquatic plants now that they exist.
- **2026-09-25, P4 coast and sea.**
  - *Swell (`SeaSwell`, `SeaSurfaceShading`):* five directional components of
    grass-test's sharpened sine drive ocean water only. The water field has no kind
    channel, so the sea is water standing at sea level with no current. The swell
    fades out in the shallows so the waterline holds. A planet-sized sea cannot take
    canonical coordinates in float32, so each chunk gets its components' phases at
    its centre in double precision (`seaSwellPhaseOrigin`). Tests prove this matches
    the absolute swell 4,000 km out and across chunk borders. The unlit sheet reads the
    waves through slope shading, a crest lift, and a fresnel tilted by the swell normal.
    Whitecaps break into streaks built from the swell's own phases. Rain and storm
    raise the sea (`seaStateUniforms.storm`). Gameplay water queries ride the same
    swell (`seaSurfaceOffset`). Config: `stylizedSurface.water.sea`.
  - *Beach berm (terrain, water domain v3):* Azgaar coasts met the sea flat at the
    water line; within 128 m of the test beach nothing rose above sea level. Land
    vertices within `ocean.beachWidthMeters` (30) of the sea now rise to
    `ocean.beachHeight` (1.8 m) when lower; shoreline vertices keep their height.
    It costs nothing measurable per chunk, and inland ground never builds the
    distance field.
  - *Swash (`CoastSwashShading`, terrain material):* as a height above still
    water, after grass-test. It draws a film behind the front, a broken foam line on
    it, and wet sand from wash memory plus a damp band. Lakes and rivers get none.
    Config: `stylizedSurface.water.coast`.
  - *Rain rings (`RainRippleShading`):* on all water, as dense and bright as the
    rain is heavy. The lattice is hashed as integers from each chunk's whole-metre
    origin, so it is exact anywhere. Verified in the app: irregular rings, no lattice.
  - *Beach pebbles (`coastStones`):* rock placements on ground up to 1.8 m above
    the sea, clustered. They share `stonePlacementSink` with the river stones. 466
    of them near the test beach, with no collision errors.
  - *Not needed / deferred:* an abyss band is not needed, because the domain caps
    depth at 24 m and colour saturates by 6 m. Culling scatter while the camera is
    underwater is a performance-only change, deferred to a perf-QA pass. Sand
    footprints and kicked sand wait for P5's deformation field.
  - *Found:* the water material's noise, voronoi and caustic patterns hash canonical
    coordinates and degrade into a regular lattice at planet scale. That was already
    the case with the swell off. It is flagged as its own task.
- **2026-09-25, P5 snow: accumulation, grass gate, and a culling bug.**
  - *Snow cover (`SnowAccumulation`):* replaces the 26 m snow line, which whitened
    most of Eldara (land median 74 m). Snow now follows altitude (from 700 m, full by
    950 m), biome (glacier full, tundra 0.7 by tile id, which is the Azgaar biome id),
    slope, and wind (windward faces scoured, lee faces loaded). Hollows hold more, and
    noise breaks the edge into drifts. The near bake and the far terrain use the same
    band and biome cover, and a test keeps them in step.
  - *Grass gate:* the surface mask evaluates the same snow per cell (`snowAtPoint`,
    shared noise and seed), so grass stops at the drawn snow edge.
  - *Culling bug:* terrain slots shared one flat plane displaced in the shader and
    were culled against the flat plane's bounds. From high ground looking out, every
    chunk was culled and the sky dome's pale underside showed instead. That was the
    white I had taken for snow at the waterfall. It was isolated by hiding layers one
    at a time: near terrain, far terrain, fog, post-processing. Each slot now has its
    own geometry over the shared buffers, with bounds fitted to its page's heights
    (`TerrainSlotBounds`). Verified: a 965 m glacier shows snow relief, and 496 m
    taiga shows green ground.
  - *Snow shading (`SnowSurfaceShading`):* on the baked snow weight. Faces turned
    from the sun take a cool blue backscatter. Sparse facet glints show when you look
    across the snow into the sun, and fade rather than alias once cells fall below a
    few pixels. Glint cells are hashed as integers from each chunk's whole-metre
    origin, so they are exact anywhere, and they sit behind a branch that only snow
    pays for.
  - *Footprints (`groundDeformationState`, `FootprintShading`):* every footfall stamps
    an oriented heel-and-toe print into a toroidal 256² texture over a 16 m window
    around the player (6.25 cm texels). The terrain darkens and cools prints in snow,
    and darkens them on the beach band. They fade over 90 s. Each texel records the
    window it was stamped in, so aliased prints one window away are rejected, and a
    one-texel margin keeps linear filtering from blending that ID away. The shader
    addressing is exact at planet scale, and a test replays it in JS against the CPU
    stamp 7,000 km out. Verified: a soft, alternating trail on a glacier.

- **2026-09-25, P9 audio.** The CC0 bank (61 mp3s, checked against its `CATALOG.md`;
  the uncatalogued root files were left out) is in `public/audio/cc0/`. `SampleBank`
  fetches and decodes on first use. A sound that isn't decoded yet doesn't queue: the
  synth plays that event instead, so nothing arrives late and out of step.
  - *Footsteps:* each footfall's surface comes from `classifyFootstepSurface`:
    - wading → water;
    - snow ≥ 0.5 → snow (the same `snowAtPoint` the terrain draws);
    - wetland → mud;
    - desert, road or the 0–1.8 m beach band → gravel;
    - forest biomes → leaves;
    - anything else → grass.

\n    Each surface has its own event with recorded variants, picked by stride with a
    small rate jitter. Snow stays a lower synth crunch because the bank has no snow
    recording.
  - *Ambient (`WorldSoundscape` → `AmbientSoundscape`):* 25 tiles on three rings
    (10/35/80 m) around the camera, plus height above the sea, rain, wind, sun and
    swimming, are resampled every 0.4 s into weights (`soundscapeWeights`).
    - Beds (forest, wetland, shore, open-ground wind, rain light/medium/heavy) ease
      toward their weights.
    - Wildlife calls fire at random intervals and stereo positions: birds and crows
      by day, crickets at night, frogs in wetland. Rain thins them out.
    - The nearest river fall within 400 m roars, louder for bigger drops. The roar is
      a slowed-down water loop, panned by the fall's bearing from the camera.
    - Going under water silences it all, and muting audio fades the ambient bus out.

\n    This stands in for `RegionalWeights` (§4.3). Tile sampling is synchronous on
    cached generator blocks.
  - Verified in the app (Eldara, own Chromium):
    - forest bed at 0.35; heavy rain at 0.9 intensity, with the birds cut to 0.1;
    - 72 m from a 22 m fall: roar 0.41, shore bed 0.25, pan −0.77 after turning
      around;
    - muting brings the bus from 0.6 to 0.05 in 4 s;
    - every sample request returned 200.

\n    Not done: true 3D (HRTF) emitters. Stereo pan is enough for an ambient layer.
- **2026-09-25, P7 cloud shadows and a sky precision fix.**
  - *Sky (pre-existing bug):* the dome sampled its cloud noise at canonical camera
    metres ÷ 180. On Eldara that is around 90,000 units, where the noise hash
    (`fract(p × 127.1)`) has no float32 bits left, so clouds collapsed into radial
    streaks or vanished. The camera coordinate is now wrapped in double precision
    every 512 cloud units (92 km; crossing a wrap shifts the field once), and the
    clouds are soft cumulus again anywhere on the map.
  - *Cloud shadows (`CloudShadow`):* each surface samples the cloud the dome draws
    in front of the sun, as seen from that surface, using the same motion and
    coordinates, so a shadow falls where the sky shows the sun behind a cloud. It
    enters through three's `receivedShadowNode`, which scales only the sun's shadow
    term, so ambient light is untouched and it keeps working past the 120 m shadow
    map.
    - Applied to terrain, grass, the tree prototypes (their LOD clones inherit it)
      and the impostors. It is idempotent per material.
    - Buildings (construction materials, other sessions' files) don't take it yet.
    - It uses two fbm octaves of the dome's four.
    - `sky.cloudShadows` {enabled, strength 0.45}; disabled compiles no nodes.
      `skyView.setCloudShadowStrength` lets weather deepen it later.
  - Perf A/B (headed `chunk-cross`, warmup 8, duration 10, dev-alt): 39.5 FPS and 30
    hitches with shadows, 37.7 FPS and 29 hitches without, which is noise.
- **2026-09-25, P7 rain wetness.** `SurfaceWetness` accumulates rain into one shared
  uniform. Full rain soaks dry ground in 40 s, drizzle holds the ground at its own
  level, and it dries over 240 s after the rain stops. This is the wetness part of
  `EnvironmentState` (§4.2).
  - `RainWetnessShading` applies it to the terrain after the coast swash. Exposed
    ground darkens by up to 30%, and its roughness falls toward 0.55, never above
    what was baked, so shores keep their sheen. Snow is left dry, and the baked
    canopy (now exposed by the baked surface) keeps 70% of the rain off the forest
    floor.
  - Settings live in `stylizedSurface.wetness` and are resolved by the config loader.
    The accumulator runs in the frame loop from the weather's rain.
  - Verified facing a 10° sun over a meadow: soaked ground picks up a soft sheen
    through the grass and darkens elsewhere. 0.22 and 0.4 read as standing water.
  - Not yet: grass, rocks, buildings and characters don't change when wet. The
    building side has to keep the workshop preview in agreement, so it waits for
    those files' owners.
- **2026-09-25, P7 time of day × weather.** The seven grass-test presets are ported
  as partial overrides of `stylizedSurface.sky` (`sky/SkyPresets.js`): Highfield,
  Emberfall, Stillmeadow, Galewind, Lowsway and Moonrise, plus `configured`, the sky
  exactly as tuned, which stays the default.
  - `SkyLook` resolves, blends and greys looks. `SkyLookController` eases a change
    of time over 2.5 s. Weather adds an overcast (rain 0.8, storm 1, snow 0.6,
    sandstorm 0.4 × intensity) that drains colour, weakens the sun, closes the
    clouds, softens cloud shadows and thickens fog. It greys any time, so a rainy
    night stays night.
  - The sky is written only while a look is changing, so capture tools that set the
    lights directly keep them.
  - A *Time* selector heads the weather panel; the choice is remembered per browser.
  - What follows a look:
    - the sky dome's colours, sun and cloud density, now uniforms;
    - the sun vector, turned in place, which carries grass, water, the character and
      post-processing with it;
    - the god rays' shared vector, their tint, and a new light scale on both god-ray
      outputs;
    - the hemisphere and directional lights;
    - fog colour and density;
    - cloud-shadow sun geometry and strength;
    - the far terrain's horizon haze;
    - the water, which is unlit, through a brightness and reflection tint
      (`sky/skyLight.js`) relative to the configured look, so that look renders
      unchanged;
    - the soundscape's night (crickets instead of birds).
  - Verified: Emberfall golden hour and Moonrise night on a meadow, and a daytime
    storm overcast. A pale band on the moonrise horizon turned out to be volumetric
    height-fog scattering at daytime strength; the god rays' light scale fixed it.
    No console errors in normal use.
  - Not yet: an animated day/night cycle, stars, and a moon disc distinct from the
    sun.
- **2026-09-25, P7 falling leaves.** `FallingLeaves` puts 400 procedural leaves in a
  36 m box that wraps around the walking camera. Each leaf's fall, wind drift, swing
  and tumble are a function of its seed and time on the GPU, so the CPU never
  touches an instance.
  - grass-test's `LeafSystem` wasn't ported. It rewrites every instance matrix each
    frame, and its leaf textures have no recorded provenance. Our leaves draw a
    procedural leaf with a midrib in autumn tones, unlit and dimmed by the sky light
    (darker at night).
  - Density follows the share of temperate deciduous forest and temperate
    rainforest (6, 8) sampled around the camera, eased as you walk in or out. None
    fall around an orbit camera.
  - Verified: golden leaves drifting through a temperate deciduous meadow. Settings
    are in `stylizedSurface.fallingLeaves`, defaulting to `DEFAULT_FALLING_LEAVES`.
- **2026-09-25, P5 alpine trees: blocked on asset work.** `tree10/11` are cleared,
  but three things block importing them:
  1. Each GLB still carries a `Tree1_Billboard`/`TreeLOD0` billboard from the
     reference lineage, which must be stripped.
  2. The needles and snow caps are separate vertex-coloured materials
     ("Evergreen needles", "Settled snow"), which our trunk-plus-leaf extraction
     does not take.
  3. tree10 is about 23k triangles against about 630 for our forest conifers.

\n  Tree variants load before the first frame and feed the forest field, so they
  can't just stream in through residency. Next step: an offline extract that strips
  the billboard, merges needles and snow into the leaf part (vertex colours kept),
  decimates to about 2k triangles, and publishes through the runtime asset pipeline.
  Then add the trees as `treeVariants` with `tileIds: [9, 10]`.
- **2026-09-25, P5 powder kicks.** `SnowPowderKicks`: every footfall on snow (the
  footstep classifier's `snow`) throws powder forward and up from the boot.
  - Twelve kick slots live in a uniform array, reused oldest first; each has nine
    camera-facing puffs animated on the GPU. A footfall writes one slot, so an idle
    walker costs nothing, and the mesh hides once the last kick settles.
  - Kicks are stronger at a run. Puffs are born scattered around the boot, and sit
    on the snow rather than cutting into it.
  - Kicks in flight ride floating-origin snaps. The puffs dim with the sky light.
  - Verified running on a 965 m glacier: one kick per footfall, about every
    0.25 s, soft puffs at each boot.
  - Where a puff overlaps the moving legs, TRAA reprojection leaves some hatching.
    It is exaggerated by the harness's irregular frames and applies to every
    transparent effect over moving geometry.
  - Ambient spindrift is not included.
- **2026-09-25, P5 snow-country air.** `SnowCountryWeight` measures how deep in snow
  country the ground under the camera is. It samples 17 tiles out to 180 m (glacier
  1, tundra 0.6) and compares ground height with the terrain's own snow line
  (700 ± 250 m), taking the larger. Measuring the ground, not the camera, means an
  orbit camera over a meadow stays over a meadow.
  - `SkyLookController` eases toward it at 0.15 per second and applies
    `snowCountryLook` after the time of day and the overcast. The horizon and fog
    pale with a cool cast, the zenith cools, the sun warms slightly, and snow
    bounce lifts the ambient light by 15%. Haze thickens by 35%.
  - Every change is a relative tint or scale, so a moonlit summit stays moonlit.
    That stands in for grass-test's absolute low-warm-sun blend.
  - Tile sampling for the leaves, the soundscape and snow country now shares
    `world/sampleTilesAround.js`.
  - Verified on a 965 m glacier: weight 1, fog `91bfd9` → `9dbdd4`, ambient
    2.0 → 2.3. A paler, hazier horizon than the same view forced to lowland air.
- **2026-09-25, P5 ridged mountain relief (terrain change, re-import).**
  `world/MountainRidges.js` is a three-octave ridged multifractal. Wavelengths are
  768, 320 and 128 m, none near the 2 m cell, and a crest in one octave strengthens
  the next, so detail gathers on ridgelines.
  - It is centred so crests rise and gullies sink around Azgaar's height. Strength
    runs from relief fraction 0.3 to 0.65, so lowland pays nothing, and it is scaled
    by mountainness guidance where a world has it.
  - Settings: `import.azgaarRidges` {heightMeters 90, startRelief 0.3,
    fullRelief 0.65}. They are validated at config load and stamped into the world's
    terrain metadata at import, like the vertical exaggeration.
  - Saved worlds keep smooth mountains until they are re-imported (the agreed
    re-import window, shared with water domain v3). The far backdrop's column
    sampler carries the same crests, so near and far terrain agree.
  - The generator's value noise moved to `world/valueNoise2d.js` unchanged; all 62
    generator, water and import tests are identical.
  - Cost: chunk workers only. On high ground a height sample goes from 0.15 to
    0.25 µs, about 0.4 ms more per 65×65-vertex chunk off the main thread; lowland
    is unchanged. `qa:perf` scenarios don't use an imported world, so a direct
    benchmark stood in for the A/B.
  - Verified by importing Eldara with and without ridges and standing at the same
    1,240 m spot: a crest now cuts the skyline where the smooth import is a
    plateau.
  - *Couloirs and crest notches (2026-09-28, §11 item 11):* both ported onto the
    same field, from the donor's `AlpineRegion` landform. A couloir is one finer
    ridged octave (64 m) on a lattice rotated 37°, so its chutes cut the flanks
    between the ribs instead of lining up with the crests, gated to the mid-flank.
    A crest notch is a ridged octave at 128 m gated to the ridge line, so the
    summit breaks into saddles and pinnacles. Both are centred on their field's
    measured mean, so neither shifts the range's height, and both inherit the
    relief gate and the mountainness scale. Config `import.azgaarRidges`
    gains `couloirMeters` (8) and `notchMeters` (9), validated and stamped at
    import like the rest. The far backdrop carries them through the same
    `ridgeRelief` the near terrain uses. A world imported before them has no
    depths, so both terms stay off and its mountains are unchanged.
  - Cost of the two new terms: on high ground a height sample goes from ~0.27 to
    ~0.32 µs (+~0.05 µs, ~+19 % on the benchmark machine), and a world with the
    terms off matches the old cost exactly (the noise is skipped, not multiplied
    by zero). Terrain change, so the world is re-imported and a `qa:perf` A/B is
    outstanding.
- **2026-09-25, P5 snowfall.** WebGPU snow is now `weather/snowfall/SnowfallField`, in
  three populations: 2,600 fine flakes over a 42 m column, 900 medium flakes over
  14 m, and 48 soft out-of-focus discs near the lens.
  - Every flake is a function of its seed and time. Flakes wrap in world space, so a
    walker moves through the snow instead of carrying it.
  - The drift is the integral of the wind and its gusts, taken on the CPU each
    frame, so a gust never jumps the field. Each flake swirls on its own phase, and
    flakes collapse at the lens.
  - Flakes face the camera fully: the old crossed quads turned edge-on from above
    and drew as lines. They dim with the sky light.
  - It implements the same handle as before, so `weather_controller` and the WebGL
    fallback (the old crossed-quad shader) are untouched.
  - **Regional snow** (after grass-test): snow country snows lightly (0.3) with the
    weather off, and snow weather only makes it heavier. It is suppressed under
    rain, storm and sandstorm. It is driven by the same `SnowCountryWeight` as the
    snow-country air.
  - Verified on the glacier: light regional snow with the weather off, no line grid
    looking down, and heavy snow at 1.2.
- **2026-09-25, P8 graded trails (terrain change, re-import).** Azgaar's land routes
  (Eldara: 310 trails and 4 roads, points about 70 km apart; sea routes left out)
  are imported into the macro source (`import/AzgaarRoutes.js`) and graded into
  the ground by `world/TrailGrading.js`.
  - Each route is smoothed with a Catmull-Rom spline, then split into 1 km arcs,
    each traced lazily on first use with its ends pinned to the ground.
    Forward and backward passes cap the grade at 0.14; an arc whose pins demand
    more takes just the grade it needs, spread evenly. Cut is capped at 10 m and
    fill at 4 m, with banks that widen with the cut.
  - The result doesn't depend on which arc is traced first (tested), and
    neighbouring arcs meet exactly.
  - Settings: `import.azgaarTrails`, stamped at import like the ridges.
  - The generator's `sampleHeight` is now the graded view of `sampleTerrainHeight`,
    so rivers still carve across trails. Cells the path covers report the editor's
    Road tile, so the existing path shading (tread, verge, ruts, cleared grass)
    draws them.
  - Cost: a height sample away from routes is +0.02 µs; inside a route's 16 km
    bucket it is +0.25 µs, about 1 ms per chunk in the workers.
  - Verified: a 6 m road through temperate forest meadow, grass cleared with a
    verge, and a road band across a glacier.
  - Follow-ups:
    - The Road tile's outline is per cell, so diagonal routes show a stair-stepped
      edge. Driving the path mask from the route distance instead would fix it.
    - Roads through glaciers paint as bare dirt.
- **2026-09-25, §10 audio bank v2.** grass-test's rebuilt bank (85 files, every source
  and licence in its catalog) is merged into `public/audio/cc0`: 114 files, 3.3 MB,
  with one `CATALOG.md` covering both generations.
  - v2 replaces the footsteps. Snow is now recorded rather than synthesized, and
    there is a new sand surface for beaches and hot desert; cold desert and road
    stay gravel.
  - v1's forest, wetland and lake beds, three-level rain and wildlife calls stay.
  - The soundscape gains beds for open-ground meadow wind, alpine wind (from the
    snow-country weight), jungle day and night (biomes 5 and 7), sea surf, river
    stream, lake shore and night crickets.
  - New calls: v2 meadow birds, crows, seagulls, single waves, jungle piha and
    parrots, cicadas, frogs and mosquitoes.
  - Water kinds are sampled on rings out to 200 m. Waves and gulls come in on low
    ground by the sea and pan toward the sea's bearing.
  - Verified on an Eldara beach: surf bed at 0.39, waves and gulls calling from the
    sea side, and 24 sample requests, all 200.
- **2026-09-27, entering player mode: 17 s → 1 s.** The first walk-mode frame took
  about 17 s, and the terrain policy made every later orbit/walk switch cost the same.
  There were two causes:
  1. `ViewModeSurfacePolicy` flipped terrain `side` per mode (DoubleSide orbit,
     FrontSide walk). `side` is part of the render-object key, so every switch
     rebuilt all 49 terrain node graphs at about 650 ms each. Terrain is now
     DoubleSide at creation in every mode. Front faces saved nothing measurable
     (uncapped 1920×1080 walk: 157–179 fps front, 165–171 fps double).
  2. Walking renders through the god-rays scene pass (its own render target) while
     orbiting renders to the screen, so the first walk frame built every resident
     material for that path. Each of the 49 terrain slots had its own copy of the
     graph, and three keys builds by node id.
  - Fix: one terrain material shared by all slots (`materials/TerrainSlotBindings.js`).
    Each slot mesh carries its own tile, height, surface-mask and forest-floor
    textures, `chunkCenter` and bake GPU state, and the shared nodes read them per
    drawn object. The bake bridge now finds the state on `slot.mesh`.
  - Pitfall hit on the way: `TextureNode.setup` resets `updateType`, which silently
    drops `onObjectUpdate`. The per-object textures therefore use
    `setUpdateMatrix(true)`. Before that, several slots drew another slot's flat
    data as a grey sheet.
  - A background prewarm of the walk path was tried and removed. It froze orbit for
    about 20 s and saved nothing.
  - Measured on Eldara: first walk frame 16.5 s → 0.8–1.1 s (one terrain build,
    ~0.6 s; other slots 0 ms). Verified all 49 slots bind their own data by swapping
    every slot's height texture and seeing every chunk move.
  - Follow-up: after an import, the far-terrain ring job samples forest habitat and
    water distance over thousands of chunks, about 14 s of CPU spread over frames;
    the lake and trail tile lookups add to it.
- **2026-09-27, §10 ambient layer (particles, breath, plumes).** Ported to
  `stylized/ambient/` from grass-test's ambient effects.
  - Config: `config/ambient-effects.yaml`, converted from grass-test's ~2.8 units
    per metre; plumes are re-tuned for this world's crest spacing.
  - Eleven GPU particle fields (`AmbientParticleField`): diamond dust, spindrift,
    blowing sand, surf spray, pollen, dandelion seeds, night fireflies, jungle
    spores, canopy shafts, midges and lake mist.
    - They hug the ground through `LocalGroundHeight`, a 64² half-float patch
      around the focus stored relative to its centre.
    - Per-particle masks read the ground against the sea and lake levels, so spray
      stays over the sea and beach sand stays on the beach.
    - Region weights (`ambientRegions`) come from ring samples of tiles and water
      plus `SnowCountryWeight`. grass-test's presets are mapped from this world's
      times of day and weather (`ambientPresets`).
  - Extras driven by the same weights:
    - `BreathPuffs`: 16 CPU puffs from the hero's `Head` bone in snow country,
      through a new `breathSource()` on the character views.
    - `RidgePlumes`: crests found around the focus above the snow line, rescanned
      every 350 m, stored relative to the scan centre.
  - `main.js` holds one `WorldAmbience` adapter.
  - Verified in the app:
    - glacier: diamond dust, gusting spindrift, breath (up to 4 puffs, visible in
      64% of frames), 2 plume crests;
    - beach: surf spray over the sea only, blowing sand;
    - no shader errors.
  - Not yet: blown snow and sand streaks in the terrain, grass gust sheen, frost.
    Heat shimmer and jungle mist read the scene or depth and need an A/B first.
- **2026-09-27, grass: the two-band LOD, a resumable build, and density coverage.**
  Grass was the least-ported subsystem, and the donor's grass pass is the one place
  it does something this project had no equivalent of. Three changes, plus the
  silhouette families (§5.8).
  - *The far band is live.* `nearRadius` is 0 rather than 1, so the eight chunks
    around the camera draw the single-triangle blade and only the camera's own chunk
    keeps the tapered one. No ring and no chunk is added — the resident set is the
    same nine either way — so the saving is purely on the draw side: 40 triangles per
    clump down to 8 across eight chunks. Until now `nearRadius === residentRadius`
    meant `farGeometry` was never even built, so the whole band was dead code.
    Note the `residentRadius: 2` regression in `docs/perf-qa.md` is *not* answered by
    this: it was build cost, and this adds no build.
  - *The per-chunk build is one resumable pass.* A page arrives at full density, and
    the chunk takes a prefix of each cell's clumps with the canopy taken out. That
    was `compactGrassScatter` + `filterScatterByForest`: two walks over two freshly
    allocated copies of the chunk, about 1.4 MB of garbage, in one frame.
    `grassScatterBuild.js` does it in a single pass straight into the instance
    buffers, resumable at `streaming.grassScatterGroupsPerSlice` source cells a
    frame. `compactGrassScatter` is deleted; the canopy filter is now reached by the
    main-thread fallback path too, which previously grew grass straight through the
    forest floor.
  - *Ring boundaries are thinned, not stepped.* The per-ring compaction can only keep
    whole clumps per cell, so a chunk's density is a step and the ring boundary is
    where it shows; the last ring also used to end at a line. `grassLodCoverage` owns
    the density law and retires blades by their own rank to make up the difference,
    capped by an `outerFadeMeters` tail that hands over to the terrain shader's faked
    ground cover. The rate is a *ratio* against what the chunk was compacted to, so
    it can only thin — it cannot double-count the falloff or invent blades.
    Blade rank rides in the spare channel of `bladeWind`, rolled from the same index
    in both bands so a chunk crossing the band boundary retires the same blades
    either side.
  - *Silhouettes.* `slender`, `reed` and `broadleaf` are ported as generated profiles
    with the donor's per-shape width scale (what makes a reed a reed), and
    `bladeProfiles.biomeSets` gives a biome a set — wetland reeds, a grassland mix,
    narrower blades under forest. The donor's `tufted` is a billboard family and is
    deliberately absent: the near band here is a blade strip, and a billboard
    silhouette would need the far-card system below.
  - *Found and fixed on the way:* the material measured every distance from the
    canonical `worldXZ`, which is the same vector as render space only while the
    floating origin sits at the world's centre. On an imported planet-scale world the
    flutter fade and the blade-normal fade were therefore permanently off.
  - *Tests:* coverage law and its seam invariants, the build's equivalence to the
    two-pass version it replaced and its insensitivity to slice size, the slot's
    coverage corners and interrupted-build invalidation, the silhouette family
    characters, and biome-set resolution. The coverage shading is assembled in Node
    (`tests/grassLodCoverageShading.test.js`), which caught a missing `uniform`
    import that would have drawn a blank field.
  - *Not done:* the far-grass billboard cards and their atlas. Assessed and left out:
    the donor needs them because its far representation is a blade, but here the far
    band is already one triangle per *clump* — 96 blades — which is cheaper per blade
    than a card, and this grass is fill-bound rather than triangle-bound, so a card
    would not pay for its atlas, material and second instance buffer. `tufted` and
    the mid patch representation stay out with it. The browser A/B for the three
    changes above is outstanding (`docs/perf-qa.md`).
- **2026-09-27, §11 item 1 starts: seabed rocks.** The first piece of beach and water
  life, and the one that needed no new view: boulders are stones, so they ride the
  rock layer as a third placement mode beside `rocks.riverbank` and `rocks.coast`,
  and inherit drawing, fading, collision and tree blocking from it.
  - *`seabedRocks.js`* is `coastStones.js`'s shape with a depth band instead of a
    height band, because a coast here is ground standing below the water rather than
    an analytic curve: candidates on a jittered grid are kept where the ground is
    1.2–11 m below sea level, clustered so they gather in drifts. Five height probes
    reject a chunk that is dry or too deep before a candidate is tried.
  - *Where the donor's seaward bias went.* The donor clusters its boulders seaward of
    the shoreline. Here the bias is toward the *shallows*, and for a harder reason
    than taste: the water's colour saturates by about six metres (P4 above), so a
    boulder deeper than that is drawn and never seen. `keep` falls off with depth and
    reaches zero at `maxDepth` — measured on a test chunk, 27 stones at 2.5 m, 8 at
    9 m, 2 at 10 m, none at 11 m.
  - *`clusterNoise` moved* from `coastStones.js` to `stonePlacementSink.js`, where
    both strand layers now share one copy rather than two.
  - *Not yet:* starfish, strand-line shells and driftwood, coastal groundcover, sea
    algae and the tropical palms. The first three need a view of their own — they are
    not stones — so they are the next piece rather than a config change.
- **2026-09-27, §11 item 1: shore life (starfish, shells, driftwood, creeping
  leaves).** The donor generates all of this geometry in code, and that is the part
  worth keeping: it costs no asset, no atlas and no load. The work was therefore
  two small pieces and a wiring, not four new systems.
  - *A layer can now take prototypes built in code.* `StylizedGroundDetailView`
    grew `appendProceduralPrototypes`, which pushes the same bookkeeping
    `appendVariants` does — height offsets, placement, water, biome and the new
    strand rules — and then hands the new slice to the same
    `createInstancedRenderers`. Everything downstream is unchanged: the same
    deterministic per-chunk manifest, the same Matérn spacing, the same rebuild
    path and the same disposal. A layer of these installs synchronously at boot
    because there is nothing to fetch.
  - *`strandPlacement.js`* is the band rule for the two sides of the waterline,
    written as a sibling of `AquaticPlacement` because it answers the same question
    with the other signal: `AquaticPlacement` reads the water field's kind, depth
    and shore distance, and this reads metres above sea level, which is the only
    signal there is on dry ground. A rule that names one side of its band is a
    config error rather than a silent no-op.
  - *`proceduralFlora.js`* holds the shapes — a ten-triangle starfish, an
    eight-triangle scallop, a two-triangle leaf, a tube twig and a ribbon clump —
    each authored at its **natural size**. That is a deliberate departure from the
    donor's per-species scale: this project's ground-detail manifest carries one
    scale band for a whole layer, so a starfish and a 1.6 m log can only differ in
    size if their geometry differs. The layer's band is then variation around it.
  - *The bands, read as a set:* shells 0.02–1.8 m above sea level, starfish
    0.05–1.4, driftwood 0.1–2.4 (the strand line, above the swash), creeping leaves
    1.4–26 inland. The layer's own 0.02–26 is the shore those sit inside, and the
    validator refuses a species that strays past it or names no band at all.
  - *Cost:* one draw call per prototype, two to ten triangles per instance, no
    texture, no viewport read, nothing quality-gated. 96 candidates a chunk over a
    resident radius of 2, most rejected by the band before they cost anything.
  - *Not yet:* sea algae, lake flora and the tropical palms, and the seaweed sway
    the donor puts on its underwater plants.
- **2026-09-27, §11 item 1 finished but for the palms: water plants and their sway.**
  Sea algae (seagrass, kelp, red tufts) and lake flora (eelgrass, waterweed,
  pondweed, lily pads), all generated, all riding the aquatic layer the authored
  lake plants already use.
  - *The placement rule was already there.* `evaluateAquaticPlacement` takes a depth
    band, a placement mode, a shore-distance band and a set of water kinds — which is
    the donor's own species table, expressed in this project's water field. So each
    species is a rule and a shape, not a new system: seagrass 0.6–4 m in sea or lake,
    kelp 1.2–9 m sea only, red algae 0.8–7 m in both, eelgrass 0.5–5 m lake only,
    waterweed 0.8–7 m, pondweed 1–8 m, and pads floating on the surface within 22 m
    of a bank. The bands overlap on purpose — a bed that is only seagrass to 3 m and
    only kelp past it has a line drawn across it.
  - *Sway.* `plantSway.js` is the donor's `plantMaterial`: 0.3 for kelp, 0.18 for
    seagrass, 0.1 for the algae. It is vertex-only, so it costs nothing per pixel and
    nothing to disable, and its per-instance phase comes free from
    `instanceDither.y` — the stable seed the lod runtime already writes for every
    instanced detail — so a bed does not sway in lockstep without a new buffer.
    Blades are authored one metre tall whatever the species so the shader can read
    the height fraction straight off the vertex; the species' real height scales the
    vertical only, or kelp would come out as broad as it is tall.
  - *Two config errors the tests caught,* both of which would have placed nothing at
    all: water kinds are numeric constants and not the strings `'ocean'`/`'lake'`, and
    the layer has to be `enabled` for a view to exist to draw the species into.
  - *Cost:* seven species, `blades x segments x 2` triangles each — 12 to 30 — over
    the layer's existing 24 candidates a chunk. No new texture, no viewport read.
  - *Not yet in this item:* the coastal palms, which need the coastal-jungle kit and
    are §11 item 4.
- **2026-09-27, §11 item 2 starts: rock weathering.** The donor's `rockWeathering`,
  ported onto the cloned authored rock material.
  - *Why it matters:* the stylized rock pack's albedo is near-white and uniform, so
    bare stones read as plastic set on the grass. Moss on the up-facing faces in
    broken patches, shaded undersides, dust on the bare tops and a toned albedo are
    what make them sit in the world — and all of it is ALU, with no extra texture.
  - *The tonal breakup is the other half:* world-space sine products give stones
    sharing one template different tones, so a scree field stops reading as copies.
  - *The waterline is adapted, not copied.* The donor reads its sea and lake levels
    from the fixed map's config. Here the sea level is the only globally known water
    level — a lake's surface belongs to its own body — so the wet, glossy splash band
    keys on sea level, and a stone on a lake shore keeps its dry band. A per-point
    answer needs the rock material to bind the water field, which is a larger change
    than the effect is worth; noted rather than silently approximated away.
  - *The donor's character-occlusion dither is deliberately not ported for rocks.*
    This project's `CharacterOcclusion` cuts foliage only, because rocks are solid
    obstacles and cutting them reads as a hole in the world.
  - *Live from config:* every strength is a setting, resolved and range-checked at
    config load so a typo is an error naming its path rather than stones that turn
    green in the world.
  - *Not yet in this item:* bark weathering (moss on the shaded side, rain streaks,
    snow on upward faces, an earthy base), the contact shade where trees and rocks
    meet the ground, and the donor's `heightBlend`/`pebbleField` node helpers for
    terrain terms.
- **2026-09-27, §11 item 2: bark weathering.** The donor's `barkWeathering`, on the
  authored trunk material.
  - *What it does:* moss on the trunk's shaded side and its root tops in broken
    patches, thickest near the ground; rain running down it in dark streaks; snow
    caught on the upward faces up in snow country; an earthy base where soil
    splashes; and a per-tree colour drift, so a stand stops reading as one model
    repeated. All ALU on the trunk, no extra texture.
  - *Three adaptations, each of which this project earns.* Height up the trunk comes
    from `positionGeometry.y` rather than a terrain heightfield texture — a tree
    prototype's origin is its trunk base, so that is the height directly, and it
    scales with the instance, which is what a bigger tree wants anyway. Rain is the
    shared wetness accumulator the ground itself darkens by, rather than a second
    rain value that could disagree with the ground the tree stands on. The per-tree
    seed is `instanceDither.y`, which the lod runtime already writes, so a tree keeps
    its drift across its LOD levels with no new attribute.
  - *The snow band is threaded, not restated.* Bark has to whiten at the altitude
    the ground under it does, and the band lives in `world.farTerrain` — a different
    top-level config key the surface config cannot see. So the composition root hands
    it down: `main.js` → surface view → tree view → trunk material. A second copy of
    the snow line in the surface config would have been the easy move and would have
    been free to drift; with no band handed down the snow term is simply off, rather
    than defaulting to zero and whitening every trunk in the world.
  - *Not yet in this item:* the waterline algae tint (the wet band itself came with
    the rock weathering), the contact shade where trunks and boulders meet the
    ground, and the donor's terrain terms — `heightBlend`, `pebbleField`, scree and
    the straw fringe at path edges, which have to fit the baked terrain material and
    its texture budget.
- **2026-09-27, §11 item 2: waterline algae and contact shade.** The two pieces left
  in the item's shader half.
  - *Waterline algae,* on the rock's splash band: the donor darkens the band, and the
    green in its upper half is what makes it read as a tide mark rather than as
    shadow. It sits above the wet line rather than with it — algae needs the water
    but does not live under it — and it carries its own strength, because a lake
    stone wants the wet band without the sea's algae.
  - *Contact shade,* from the donor's `writeContactShade`: a soft, quadratically
    falling patch where a trunk or boulder meets the ground, painted into the second
    channel of the per-chunk ground texture the forest floor already uses, so the
    ground reads canopy and contact in one fetch. It is ambient occlusion rather than
    shadow, so it does not move with the sun and it holds past the shadow map.
  - *The resolution forced the design, and the test found it.* At 16 texels over a
    128 m chunk one texel is **eight metres**, so a trunk-width patch is a fraction of
    a texel and paints nothing at all — I had a default of 2.2 m and the test refused
    to place it. The patch is therefore canopy-scale (`radiusPerScale: 7`), which is
    what a stand of trees actually darkens the ground with. A finer ground texture
    would allow trunk-scale patches; that is a memory and per-frame paint decision,
    not a shader one, and it is not taken here.
  - *Three things had to move together, or the ground reads garbage.* The texture went
    from one byte a texel to four; the terrain material now reads the second channel;
    and `TerrainMaterialBakeCpu.sampleCanopy` had a stride of one, which would have
    read the canopy out of the alpha bytes and shaded every forest by nothing. Three
    test fixtures had to follow the layout change.
  - *The ground texture's cache key now includes what is standing on it,* because a
    felled tree would otherwise leave its patch behind until the canopy happened to
    change — the same class of bug as a stale canopy.
  - *What is left in item 2:* the donor's terrain terms — `heightBlend`,
    `pebbleField`, scree and the straw fringe at path edges — which have to fit the
    baked terrain material and its texture budget.
- **2026-09-27, §11 item 2 closed: the straw fringe, and the terrain terms assessed.**
  - *Straw fringe, ported.* The donor tints the grass still growing on a path's verge
    straw at the tips. Our path wear already splits its smoothstep into a bare tread
    and the verge outside it (`stylizedPathWearMask` returns `tread` and `verge`),
    which is precisely the band the donor read off its own exclusion channel, so the
    port is the tint and not the field. It is weighted by the blade's height
    gradient: a whole blade going straw reads as a different plant rather than as the
    same grass underfoot, so only the tips dry out. Its own config block, because a
    world may want the wear that shortens blades without the colour.
  - *The three terrain terms are assessed and left out, each for a reason rather than
    for effort.* `pebbleField` is a terrain-shader Voronoi stone field; this project
    places its beach pebbles as instances already (`coastStones`, 466 of them near the
    test beach) and an instance draws and lights better than a shader stone. `scree`
    is likewise already here twice over — as compact high-density instance pockets
    (`rocks.clusterDensity`) and as the baked material's rock and scree
    classification (`screeColor`). The donor's shader versions are what it used
    *instead* of scatter it did not have.
  - *`heightBlend` is the one genuinely open technique, and it has no counterpart
    here.* It blends one textured surface layer over another using each layer's
    luminance as height, so rock breaks through grass along its raised grains instead
    of cross-fading. This project's terrain does not layer textures that way: it bakes
    a material weight and a colour per cell (`materialWeights`, `farColor`) and reads
    the result. Adopting the technique means giving those layers their own height
    textures and carrying them through the bake's byte budget — a bake-pipeline
    change, not a shader one, and one worth doing only with a measured reason.
  - **Item 2 is therefore done**: rock weathering, bark weathering, waterline algae
    and contact shade ported; the terrain terms assessed above.
- **2026-09-27, §11 item 3 starts: crest transmission, and the deep-sea assessment.**
  - *Crest transmission, ported.* A wave seen edge-on with the sun beyond it glows
    rather than reflecting, and the donor's three factors are all in it: the crest
    mask, a grazing view (look straight down and you are looking at the water, not
    through it) and the light behind the wave rather than off it. The grazing term is
    squared, which concentrates the glow in the last few degrees — where it happens on
    a real sea — and the whole thing is one uniform-times-node, so it compiles out
    entirely at zero. It is added after the reflection, because it is light that came
    through the water rather than off it.
  - *Deep-sea absorption and an abyss band: assessed, not needed.* P4 already found
    why: the water domain caps depth at 24 m and the colour saturates by about six, so
    a depth-driven absorption ramp and a separate abyss band would be shading that
    nothing can see. This is the same call the merge plan made in P4 and it still
    holds — it is not deferred effort, it is a term with no visible output.
  - *Still open in item 3: dropping the expensive layers while submerged.* The donor's
    `UnderwaterPerformanceController` hides grass and scatter when the camera is under
    the water, where the water and the fog occlude them anyway. This project's
    `UnderwaterViewController` does the environment — fog, light, near plane, sky,
    caustics — and does not touch layer visibility, so the grass and the detail layers
    still build and draw for a player who cannot see them. P4 deferred this as a
    performance-only change pending a perf QA pass; it needs a shared submerged state
    between the player's controller and the surface view, which is a small piece of
    plumbing across two systems rather than a shader change. **Closed below.**
- **2026-09-27, §11 item 3 closed: land streaming stands down under water.**
  - *`underwaterState.js`* is one number the frame shares: the player's
    `UnderwaterViewController` already computes the submerged blend every frame for
    the environment, and it now publishes that same value, so the two systems cannot
    each decide separately what "under water" means. It is a plain number rather than
    a uniform because what reads it is CPU work.
  - *Suspended, not hidden — and that difference is deliberate.* The donor hides land
    layers outright; this project's measured cost is in the *rebuilding* rather than
    in the drawing (the same finding as the grass ring and the resumable build), so
    the surface view returns before the layer pass and the build queues. Nothing is
    hidden, so nothing pops on surfacing: the field catches up over the next few
    frames instead. Water keeps updating throughout, because it is what you are
    looking at.
  - *The threshold sits well inside the transition,* not at its start: a player
    bobbing at the waterline should not start and stop the world's streaming every
    wave. The blend is also clamped, and a NaN — a missing camera, a bad frame time —
    reads as zero, because a NaN blend would suspend the land forever with nothing to
    notice it.
  - **Item 3 is therefore done**: crest transmission ported; deep absorption and an
    abyss band assessed as having no visible output; and land streaming suspends under
    water.
- **2026-09-27, §11 item 4 reconnaissance: the tropical kit, and what of it can stream.**
  Read from the donor's own manifest
  (`grass-test/public/Assets/terrain/coastal-jungle/objects/tropical-kit/manifest.json`,
  16 objects, embedded glTF PBR, double-sided, no external textures, pivot at ground
  centre, units in metres).
  - *The kit splits by weight, and our own asset policy decides which half streams.*
    This project already measured and rejected heavy authored extractions from the
    streamed detail layers (`docs/authored-natural-assets.md`, cited in
    `editor.config.yaml`): clover at 10,912 triangles and ground patches up to 52,188
    stay offline. By that yardstick the kit's **light** members stream — jungle grass
    short/tall/broad (1.4–2.2 k triangles, 98–160 KB), jungle groundcover (648),
    elephant ear (324), banana understory (360), broad-leaf module (16), fern-frond
    module (960), palm-frond module (1,536), vine-strand module (640) — and its
    **heavy** ones do not: jungle canopy tree (44,712 triangles / 3.0 MB), palm tall
    (26,208 / 1.76 MB), palm young (13,904), fern large (11,520 / 795 KB), fern small
    (6,048), hanging vine cluster (4,992). The heavy half wants the offline or impostor
    path, not a streamed variant, and taking it anyway would undo the measurement this
    project already made.
  - *The intake exists and is the path to follow:* assets are copied under
    `public/assets/ground/`, re-encoded by `optimize:runtime-assets`, and gated by
    `validate:runtime-assets`; the layer is then a `groundDetailVariants`-shaped list
    (see `stylizedSurface.assets.groundDetailVariants`) with `tileIds`, `weight`,
    `prototypeGroups` and a `scale`, drawn by a `StylizedGroundDetailView` of its own
    with a palette layer id — the same shape the ground-detail and aquatic layers
    already use, so no view changes are needed.
  - *Biomes:* tropical seasonal forest (5) and tropical rainforest (7), with palms
    only on the coastal edges of savanna (3) and hot desert (1) oases, as §3 has it.
  - *Nothing was implemented in this pass.* The piece is an asset intake with a size
    decision in it, and writing the import before checking it against
    `validate:runtime-assets` would be guesswork; this records the split so the intake
    can be written against it.
- **2026-09-27, §11 item 4 intake: attempted, and the blocker is precise.**
  - *The toolchain is here.* gltfpack 1.2 is already cached at
    `tmp/tools/gltfpack/v1.2/win32-x64/gltfpack.exe`, so `optimize:runtime-assets`
    runs offline; the publish convention is source `assets/runtime-sources/<scene>`
    → output `public/<scene>`, with the manifest in `assets/runtime-asset-manifest.json`
    listing every configured scene in order.
  - *Ten light members are staged* at `assets/runtime-sources/ground/tropical/`
    (jungle grass short/tall/broad, jungle groundcover, elephant ear, banana
    understory, and the broad-leaf, fern-frond, palm-frond and vine-strand modules),
    copied from the donor's `objects/tropical-kit`. Their node names were read out of
    the GLBs rather than guessed, since `prototypeGroups` has to name a real node and
    a wrong name throws when the variant is appended.
  - *The intake stops at the optimizer, for a reason worth knowing:*
    `/assets/ground/tropical/jungle-grass-short.glb: rendered triangle count changed
    from 1760 to 1540; simplification is not enabled.` gltfpack is dropping 220
    triangles of the donor's foliage — degenerate or duplicate geometry, which foliage
    cards are full of — and this pipeline's contract is that the authored triangle
    count never changes (`-si` is forbidden, and the validator re-checks the count).
  - *So the missing piece is a prepare step, not a config entry.* The canonical
    source has to be cleaned first so that what the pipeline drops is already gone —
    the same shape as `scripts/prepare-character-assets.mjs` and
    `scripts/prepare-wildlife-assets.mjs`, which exist for exactly this reason with
    other vendors' models. That script is the work: weld, drop degenerate triangles,
    and write `assets/runtime-sources/`, after which the config entries above can be
    added and the optimizer will accept them.
  - *The config entries were written and then reverted* rather than left in: a scene
    in the config without a manifest entry fails `validate:runtime-assets`, which
    `npm run verify` runs, so leaving them would have broken the tree for the sake of
    looking further along. The staged sources stay, because the prepare step needs
    them.
- **2026-09-27, §11 item 4: the prepare step works, and the kit needs a layer of its
  own — not a config entry.**
  - *The prepare script is fixed and runs.* Its accounting was the bug: it asserted
    that the triangle count fell by exactly what its own degenerate-triangle pass
    removed, but `weld` merges vertices that were only coincident to float precision,
    which turns *further* triangles degenerate, so the count falls by more. The
    invariant that can be proved is that it never *rises* — which is also the
    contract the runtime optimizer re-checks. Across the ten members: 954 degenerate
    triangles removed, 9 844 → 8 850, and `jungle-grass-short` goes 1760 → 1540, the
    exact number gltfpack had complained about.
  - *Five of the ten publish cleanly* — jungle grass short/tall/broad, jungle
    groundcover, elephant ear — at 57–73 % smaller (89.1 → 24.7 KiB for the tall
    grass). The other five (banana understory, and the broad-leaf, fern-frond,
    palm-frond and vine-strand modules) are rejected with "logical decoded geometry
    grew during optimization": gltfpack's quantisation pads a tiny mesh's attributes
    past what the source stored, and the pipeline forbids that. They need a per-asset
    pass, not a different script.
  - *The finding that matters: none of the ten can go into `groundDetailVariants`.*
    `tests/authoredAssetExtraction.test.js` asserts that every entry in that layer is
    a **published extraction output** and streams **at most 350 triangles** — it is
    the ambient ground-cover layer, and its budget was measured (clover at 10 912
    triangles cost ~87 FPS streamed). The jungle grasses are 1 540–1 960. And
    `bushVariants`, the other scanned key, has no per-variant biome gate, so tropical
    grass put there would scatter through temperate meadow.
  - *So item 4's remaining work is a layer, not an entry:* a seventh asset key added
    to the scanned list in `scripts/lib/runtime-asset-sources.mjs` (with its own
    scatter tier), a `stylizedSurface.tropicalKit` block carrying `tileIds: [5, 7]`
    and its own budget, and a `StylizedGroundDetailView` instance beside the
    ground-detail and aquatic ones. The config file now says exactly this where the
    entries would have gone, so the next person does not retry the same three dead
    ends.
- **2026-09-27, §11 item 6: the alpine prepare script is written but does not run.**
  - `node scripts/prepare-alpine-tree-assets.mjs` fails immediately, at the read of the
    first file: `tree10.glb: read failed: document.getDefaultScene is not a function`.
    `getDefaultScene` is on the **root** in `@gltf-transform` (`io.read` returns a
    `Document`; the scene accessor is on `document.getRoot()`), so this is the first of
    what may be several API slips in that script — it has never executed past its
    first call, so nothing later in it is proven either.
  - It wrote nothing: the failure is before any output, and `assets/runtime-sources/trees/alpine/`
    is empty. The five-step plan it encodes (strip `Tree1_Billboard`/`TreeLOD0`, merge
    the needles and settled-snow primitives into one vertex-coloured leaf part,
    decimate the leaf geometry to roughly 2k triangles, keep the trunk and the
    bounds) is right and is recorded above in the item-4 reconnaissance; what it needs
    is to be run and corrected against the real API, one call at a time.
  - *The tropical script, by contrast, is now known-good*, which makes the two a fair
    comparison of what a delegated script needs: the one that had already been run
    once worked after a single accounting fix, and the one that had never run did
    not run at all.
- **2026-09-27, §11 items 9 and 12 wired; 5 and 8 still not; 10 and 11 ported.**
  Status by grep rather than by report, since agents stop mid-sentence:
  - **Wired and green.** Blown streaks and frost: `terrainMaterial.js` imports and
    blends both, and `InfiniteTerrainView` resolves the streak settings. Day/night and
    stars: `main.js` constructs the `DayNightCycle`, and `StylizedSkyView` adds the
    star field and a moon disc. Valley fog went further than the agent's last message
    claimed — it is wired too, through a new `mist/ValleyFogController.js` that
    `InfiniteTerrainView` owns and `main.js` drives once a frame, with the terrain
    material blending `createValleyFogNodes` and `validateValleyFog` in the config
    validator.
  - **Ported but not wired: snow wake** (`deformation/snowWakeMath.js`,
    `SnowWakeShading.js`) and **trampling** (`trample/*`). Nothing outside those
    directories imports either yet.
  - **Ported but not wired: heat shimmer and jungle mist** — and both took
    **Outcome A**, the preferred one: neither reads the viewport depth buffer nor the
    scene colour. The jungle mist is the donor's closed form with
    `cameraPosition.distance(positionWorld)` standing in for the depth sample it
    would have taken, and the shimmer became a small angular warp of the sky dome's
    own view ray, which is the one surface this world paints procedurally. 18 tests.
    Their one real blocker is recorded: `ambientEffectsConfig.resolveAmbientEffectsConfig`
    builds an explicit return object and would DROP the new keys, so
    `config.stylizedSurface.ambientEffects` cannot carry them until it forwards them.
    **Blocker cleared:** the resolver now forwards `heatShimmer` and `jungleMist`, and
    `config/ambient-effects.yaml` ships both preset blocks. Verified green (2804
    tests). What is still owed for these two is the last step only — driving their
    uniforms in `AmbientEffectsSystem.update` (`heatShimmerUniforms.hot`/`.temperature`
    from the sand/desert region weight times a time of day, `jungleMistUniforms.weight`/
    `.ground` from the jungle region weight and an eased ground height) and then the
    two material calls: `createHeatShimmerNodes` warping the sky dome's ray in
    `StylizedSkyView.createSkyMaterial`, and `createJungleMistNodes` blended over the
    ground colour in `terrainMaterial.js`.
  - **Item 11 done, code-wise:** couloirs and crest notches are ported into
    `MountainRidges.js` as two centred, gated, config-driven terms (couloir 8 m,
    notch 9 m) that inherit through the one `ridgeRelief` call, so the far backdrop's
    column sampler carries them too. 6 new tests (10 in the file). Cost measured on
    high ground: +0.05 µs per height sample (~19 %), and terms-off matches the old
    cost exactly. **This is a terrain change: the world must be re-imported and the
    `qa:perf` A/B is outstanding.** Saved worlds keep their old mountains.
  - Still open after all of that: the gust sheen, the snow-wake and trampling wiring,
    the two mist/shimmer wiring steps, item 4's layer, item 6's variant entries, and
    the browser A/B for everything.
- **2026-09-27, §11 items 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12: modules staged, each verified alone,
  none wired yet.** Ported in six parallel workstreams, each owning new files only so
  nothing collided. Every module is in and its own tests pass; the tree is green
  (2780 tests). **What none of them is yet is connected** — no config keys were added
  and no view or material hook was made, deliberately, so the shared files stayed
  single-owner. The wiring each one still owes:

| Item | New modules | Tests | Wiring still owed |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 trampling | `stylized/trample/{trampleMath,GrassTrampleContacts,GrassTrampleField}.js` | `tests/grassTrample.test.js` (16) | `grass.trample.*` config; construct the field in `StylizedSurfaceViewBase`, update it per frame with the canonical focus, add its texture to `prewarmStreamingResources`, dispose it; pass `trampleFieldTexture`/`trampleFieldUniforms` into `StylizedGrassSlot` → `createStylizedGrassMaterial`, and blend `footInfluence` into `shrink` and `footDirection` into `finalXZ`; feed footfalls from `main.js`'s existing footstep callback |
| 7 valley fog | `stylized/mist/{ValleyFogShading,valleyFogConfig}.js` | `tests/valleyFog.test.js` (7) | `sky.valleyFog.*` config; blend `mix(color, fog.color, fog.amount)` in `terrainMaterial.js`; needs a `LocalGroundHeight` patch, a time uniform, a region weight and the sky's sun/fog colours |
| 8 snow wake | `stylized/deformation/{snowWakeMath,SnowWakeShading}.js` | `tests/snowWake.test.js` (7) | create the spine state in `main.js`, record it per frame over snow, thread it into `createTerrainMaterial` and apply `wake.apply(base)` |
| 9 blown streaks, frost | `stylized/ambient/{BlownStreaks,FrostShading}.js` | `tests/blownStreaks.test.js`, `tests/frostShading.test.js` (15) | the config keys already exist in `config/ambient-effects.yaml`; drive the uniforms from `AmbientEffectsSystem.update`, resolve both in `InfiniteTerrainView.createSharedTerrainMaterialSource`, blend in `terrainMaterial.js` |
| 10 heat shimmer, jungle mist | — | — | still to port; both read the scene or depth, so each needs its own A/B |
| 12 day/night, stars, moon | `stylized/sky/{dayNightCycle,starField}.js` | `tests/dayNightCycle.test.js` (11) | `sky.cycle.*` and `sky.stars.*` config; construct the cycle in `main.js` and call `skyLooks.setPreset(cycle.update(delta))` each frame; add the star node and a moon disc inside `StylizedSkyView`'s material |

  - *Two things learned about the fan-out itself.* Agents that own new files and are
    told exactly which files they may not touch respect it — the protected list held,
    and the shared files show only this session's own earlier edits. And an agent that
    hits its turn limit leaves half-finished work that still looks finished: the
    prepare scripts exist but `prepare-tropical-assets.mjs` fails its own accounting
    check (`360 - 14 != 340`), so item 4's and item 6's blocker is now "finish that
    script", not "write it".
  - *The grass gust sheen was left out of item 9 on purpose* — it lives in the grass
    material, which was single-owner during the fan-out, and is the one piece of the
    ambient tail still to do.

- **2026-09-27 — first rendered frames after the handover; mist and shimmer wired.**
  The handover's work had not been rendered; the app did not start. Four breaks, each
  found by a headed capture rather than by the test suite (2817 tests were green
  throughout):
  - `editor.config.yaml` had no `grass.lod.enabled`, which the validator requires —
    startup threw. Added `enabled: true`.
  - `StylizedWaterMaterial.js` used `normalize` in the crest-transmission branch
    without importing it — startup threw once that branch was reached. A file-scope
    scan of every changed/new `src` file for undeclared identifiers found no other.
  - The terrain material's fragment stage now samples **17 textures**, one past
    WebGPU's default `maxSampledTexturesPerShaderStage` of 16: the pipeline failed
    validation and the terrain did not draw. `src/render/deviceLimits.js` asks the
    adapter for up to 32 before `renderer.init()` (this adapter offers 48). The
    terrain is now at the edge of the *default* — the next texture it gains needs
    this raise on every machine, so count before adding one.
  - Grass never finished building in a chunk whose biome maps to its own blade set:
    `StylizedGrassSlot.ensureResources` built with the set the slot *already had*, so
    `update` saw a changed shape on the next frame and released and reallocated the
    slot (geometry and material) every frame. Fixed by building with the chunk's own
    set; regression test in `tests/grassSlotLod.test.js`.
  - **Jungle mist and heat shimmer wired** (handover item 1). The mist blends over the
    lit output of the terrain, grass and tree materials (`jungleMistOutput.js`) so
    nothing standing in it stays crisp; the shimmer warps the sky dome's low band. Both
    are driven from `AmbientEffectsSystem` (jungle / inland-desert weight × preset ×
    strength; the mist's ground eases under the view). Eldara has neither jungle (5,
    7) nor hot desert (1), so neither switches on there by itself; forced on in a
    temperate rainforest they render as intended, 63.6 → 62.2 fps with mist on and no
    change for the shimmer (vsync-bound, so an upper bound on the cost, not a figure).
  - *Grass look vs the donor.* Measured side by side, the donor's meadow is a dense
    knee-high field (1.5 × 0.2 units ≈ 0.54 × 0.07 m blades, `#354d12` → `#6da300`),
    while ours draws 0.10–0.32 m blades skewed short (`lengthSkew: 5`, mean 0.14 m) and
    0.014–0.032 m wide over dark ground. The handover's grass work (LOD bands,
    silhouettes, coverage) changes cost and outline, not this scale; matching the donor
    is a retune of length, width, colour and ground tint that needs its own perf A/B.

- **2026-09-28 — grass retuned to the donor's meadow.** Blades 0.32–0.62 m (skew 1.2,
  mean ~0.46 m) × 2.7–6.1 cm, donor pigment `#354d12` → `#6da300` at gradient power
  2.2, translucency 1.3 → 0.55 (taller sun-facing blades bleached white at 1.3), wind
  lean 0.05 → 0.22 and strength 0.1 → 0.2, blade-normal share 0.32 → 0.2. Config only;
  `bladesPerCell` is unchanged, so streaming, instance counts and the perf-profile
  gates are as before. Tuned live through `GrassTuning` at the taiga orbit focus,
  vsync off: 168.5/169.8 fps (into/away from the sun) before, 166.8/168.0 after.
  Still short of the donor: distant tips facing the sun sparkle near-white (thin tips
  aliasing — the donor uses alpha-to-coverage and a distance fade), and the player is
  a black silhouette into the sun (no fill on the character; not a grass issue).

- **2026-09-28 — grass-test's meadow grass system ported (`stylized/meadow/`).**
  Measured first: at its own "high" quality the donor draws **0.41 M grass
  triangles** (0.29 M blades + 61 k far cards) in 41 draws, 6.3 ms a frame on this
  machine; our clump slots drew **~20 M** (9 chunks × ~6 000 clumps × 96 blades).
  Ported, adapted to the streaming world:
  - `meadowGrassGeometry` / `meadowGrassLayout` — the donor's stable R2 stem
    sequence (every prefix covers a tile, so lower bands keep the same stems) and
    its four LOD bands (detail = segments, density = stems/m), in metres at 2.8
    donor units per metre: 8 m tiles, bands to 6 / 14 / 30 / 50 m.
  - `MeadowGroundSampler` + `meadowGrassCompaction` — the donor's per-tile
    compaction, reading height, biome, grass/water/path mask and canopy suppression
    from the *resident terrain pages* (never the generator), resumable, nearest
    tile first, 2 ms a frame, outputs pooled per band.
  - `MeadowGrassBatches` — one draw per band, a fixed slot per tile.
  - `meadowBladeShape` / `meadowBladeMaterial` / `meadowPigment` — the donor's blade
    path (silhouette per stem: slender / reed / broadleaf by biome, taper, forward
    arc, rest bend, rank-based band retirement with survivor widening) and its
    cinematic meadow pigment (dark root to lit tip at power 2.6, cool/warm patches,
    contact shade and soil at the base, per-blade value jitter, straw path verge,
    sun transmission at the tip). Wind is our world wind field, applied as the
    donor's bend angle; footprints press blades via `groundDeformationNode`; the
    gust sheen (handover item 5) is driven by the ambient layer's meadow weight.
  - `meadowCardMaterial` + `MeadowTileLayer` — the donor's far billboards: 64 m
    tiles of camera-facing cards (its three baked clump atlases merged into
    `public/assets/ground/meadow/meadow-grass-cards.webp`) from 40 to 180 m, with a
    screen-door handoff (`meadowFade`) so neither layer blends. The terrain's
    ground cover now starts at 30 m and carries the green past the cards.
  - Result at the taiga orbit focus: **1.98 M grass triangles** (1.56 M blades +
    0.42 M cards), 95 draws in the scene, 170/172 fps into/away from the sun
    (vsync off). `qa:perf chunk-cross --warmup 8 --duration 10` A/B against the
    clump slots on the same server: 94.5 vs 94.3 fps, p99 45 vs 59 ms, GPU p95 3.3
    vs 4.35 ms, 26 vs 25 hitches. On this GPU grass was not the bottleneck while
    running — the scatter manifests and world generation are (CPU profile) — so the
    win is GPU headroom and a 10× smaller triangle budget, not frame rate here.
    (A first, 2-second-warmup A/B read 76 vs 48 fps and 34 vs 5 hitches; that gap
    was streaming still in flight, and vanished at warmup 8.)
  - `grass.system: clumps` keeps the old slots for A/B. Not ported at this date (both
    revisited on 2026-09-28, see the entry below): the donor's Hi-Z occlusion pass (a
    depth pyramid — a viewport-texture cost this project
    avoids), its camera interaction map (our footprints stand in), alpha-to-coverage
    (needs MSAA), and rock trample (the clump slots flattened grass around rocks;
    the meadow does not yet). Footprints are wired and compile; a visual check of a
    trail is still owed.

## 2026-09-28 (second pass) — best of both sides: three 0.186.1, Hi-Z occlusion, the interaction fold

The instruction for this pass: the Azgaar world, the construction/workshop modules and streaming
stay this project's; all look and feel comes from grass-test; where the donor assumes a static
world, keep this host's streaming form. Three decisions were taken up front: bump three to
**0.186.1**, port the **full Hi-Z stack**, and use the donor's **live** blade fold (a per-blade
hashed direction) rather than the radial push in its dead, unimported `grass.vert.glsl`.

### three 0.185.1 → 0.186.1

`package.json` + lock only. **No TSL symbol or `three/webgpu` class used here is missing from
r186** — the risk is behavioural, so the checklist is: the `FramebufferTexture`/`DepthTexture`
`copy` patch in `src/render/patchViewportFramebufferSources.js` (highest risk: it compensates for
an r185 `ViewportTextureNode` caching quirk), the post-processing graph and its MRT, water
viewport refraction, `lod/preInstancePosition.js`'s `NodeMaterial.setupPosition` patch, partial
attribute uploads, the two indirect-draw paths, the backend-capability flags, and the
`tsl/display` addons.

Measured: `node --test` **2831 pass / 0 fail** (2836 after this pass's tests), `npm run build` ✓
with only the two pre-existing warnings — `WebGLRenderer` is not exported by `three/webgpu`, which
`vite.config.js:12`'s `^three$` → `three/webgpu` alias makes an unresolved import in
`ui/NaturalObjectThumbnails.js:20`, and that file is **pre-existing and untouched**: r186.0 lacks
the export too, so it is not a bump regression (worth fixing separately — that thumbnail path
would throw if it ever runs), and the >500 kB chunk notice. Browser QA
(`qa:postprocessing:browser`, `qa:water:acceptance`, `qa:perf`) is **outstanding**: this pass had
no GPU either.

Environment trap worth recording: `NODE_ENV=production` plus npm's `omit=dev` **strips
devDependencies on any `npm install` here** ("removed 43 packages, audited 9"). After a bump use
`set "NODE_ENV=" && npm install --include=dev`, or vite, playwright and sharp vanish.

### The donor's r186 pin was dropped

`GpuOcclusion` gated on `REVISION === '186'`. That is a coverage pin, not an API gate: every symbol
the module touches — `backend.createIndirectStorageAttribute`, `backend.draw`, `geometry.indirect`,
the depth target, `BufferAttribute.addUpdateRange` — exists in r185 as well, and this project
already drives the same indirect path in `impostor/GpuTreeImpostorBatch.js` and
`voxel/GpuVoxelChunk.js`. The port keeps only the real capability test (`isWebGPUBackend &&
backend.device && !reversedDepthBuffer && !logarithmicDepthBuffer && createIndirectStorageAttribute`).

### Hi-Z occlusion culling — `src/render/occlusion/`

Near-verbatim from the donor's `src/rendering/`: `occlusionShaders.js` (WGSL unchanged,
max-not-min mip reduction, the 5-uint indirect record), `occlusionBounds.js`, `GpuOcclusion.js`.
Three host adaptations, each deliberate:

- **Placement and the readback.** `src/render/`, beside `deviceLimits.js`, because the *editor*
  runtime is contractually free of GPU-to-CPU readback (`tests/webGpuRuntimeContract.test.js`
  scans `src/editor`). The donor's statistics readback is now opt-in
  (`renderer.gpuOcclusion.diagnostics`, shipped `false`); the visibility decision never needs it,
  and the CPU-side `backoffIfEmpty` — the thing that actually handles an open view — is
  unaffected. `tests/gpuOcclusion.test.js` pins the shipped default to `false`.
- **No clobbering of compute-compacted draws.** `occlusionDrawRange` returns null when a geometry
  already owns an indirect record, so the tree impostors' and voxel chunks' own GPU frustum culls
  are never replaced. That property is asserted directly in the new tests.
- **An explicit occluder opt-in.** The donor classifies occluders by reading a material, which
  cannot see a vertex the shader has not displaced yet — and this host's terrain is exactly that:
  one shared material whose `positionNode` raises the ground from a per-slot heightfield
  (`terrainMaterial.js:367`, `TerrainSlotBindings`). So `userData.occlusionOccluder === true`
  declares it, with `userData.occlusionProxyMaterial` supplying a depth-only proxy that displaces
  identically (built from the same material factory) and `userData.occlusionBounds` giving the
  extent the flat geometry cannot. Terrain chunks are the occluder that matters here — mountains
  hiding meadow and trees — so without this the port would find almost nothing. **The terrain
  side of that contract is designed but not yet written** (see open items).

Wired at the only site that can see the whole frame: `InfiniteTerrainView.render()` (`:455`),
constructed after `renderer.init()`, camera refreshed per frame, wrapping the existing draw. This
is sound because the bridge is geometry-keyed, so the post passes inside the same
`pipeline.render()` call are untouched; the depth prepass renders its own proxy scene into its own
target and never reads the main pass depth, so `PostProcessingGraph`'s single-MRT `scenePass` needs
no splitting. Counters: `gpuOcclusionCandidates`, `gpuOcclusionOccluders`, `gpuOcclusionCulledDraws`,
`gpuOcclusionPrepareMs`.

### The interaction fold is wired

`MeadowInteractionMap` — dead until now — is constructed by `MeadowGrassField` from a new
`settings.interaction` block (`meadowGrassConfig.js`; resolution, worldSize 27 m, recoverySpeed,
strength, bodyRadius 0.26 m, `enabled`), its texture and render-space window exposed through
`meadowUniforms`, and sampled by `foldUnderBody` in `meadowBladeShape.js` — the donor's
`#sampleInteractionBlade` with its own hash, constants and arc structure, translated from the
donor's unit-local blade into this host's metre local: the donor adds the arc in blade-width units
and scales by width afterwards, which in metres is exactly `bladeHeight × width` with the height
read in donor units (2.8 per metre). Folded last, so it folds whatever the wind has done, and gated
on the stem's own strength.

The body point is plumbed as one render-space record per frame: `main.js` builds the player's feet
from `playerController.getStatus()` in walk mode (null when paused or in edit mode, which lets the
grass stand back up rather than freezing), through `StylizedSurfaceView.update` → the base view →
`MeadowGrassField.update(timestamp, camera, body)`. The floating-origin rebase calls the new
`stylizedSurface.shiftOrigin(shiftX, shiftZ)` beside the other `shiftWorld` calls, so a re-centre
re-bases the window instead of scrolling the ink and smearing a trail the player never walked.
The far cards are deliberately not folded: the window is 27 m across and the cards start at 40 m,
so they can never see a stamp.

`tests/meadowGrass.test.js` now carries 10 tests, including that a rebase scrolls nothing and that
a recovered map uploads nothing. What is **not** yet verified is the look itself: no GPU, so the
fold's visual weight (and the `bladeHeight × width` transfer factor) is reasoned, not measured.

- **2026-09-28 — the donor's UI look, loading screen, and the rest of the grass list.**
  - *HUD* (player/hud): grass-test's cinematic layout in Inter (OFL, now in
    public/assets/fonts). Lower left, the scene (the time-of-day preset) with its
    tagline over a text legend of the controls, no panel; lower right, the
    heading-up minimap restyled as the donor's dark dial (vignette, gold N on the
    rim, biome pill on the lower rim) with `FPS · TRIS · DRAWS` beside it
    (`HudMetrics`). The renderer resets `info` before the frame callback, so the
    readout snapshots the finished frame's totals as `reset` clears them.
  - *Loading screen* (ui/LoadingOverlay + loadingTicker + loadingIris): the donor's
    key art, the stroked wordmark filling from its baseline, the lime progress line,
    and a translucent glass card with the traveller and a percentage ring that
    breathes while working and flares at 100%. Stages run as a ticker — the active
    one holds the bottom row, finished ones rise and fade. Boot and import open onto
    the world with the donor's iris; walk-mode streaming shows the card alone over
    the live world (`presentation: 'compact'`). No backdrop-filter (the existing
    guard test holds).
  - *FXAA* on the god-rays output (stylized/pipelineOutput.js). The walking view
    returns from the god-rays pipeline before the post graph, so its TRAA never ran
    while walking and MSAA stays off; FXAA removed the far-meadow sparkle at no
    measurable cost (150.8/159 vs 152.3/152.3 fps).
  - *Rocks* flatten the meadow: nothing grows under a rock and the stand is pressed
    flatter in its falloff; the chunk's rock signature joins the tile revision, so
    only tiles whose rocks changed rebuild. (A mismatch between the tile's and the
    job's revision briefly left every build restarting each frame — pinned by test.)
  - *Player interaction map* (meadow/MeadowInteractionMap): the donor's body stamp —
    blades the player wades through fold over and stand back up.
  - *Hi-Z occlusion* (render/occlusion, three 0.186.1 — already in the tree): the
    donor's GpuOcclusion, with the terrain occluding through per-chunk proxies of
    its hills. It works — 5–7 draws / ~57k triangles hidden in an Eldara valley —
    but costs 1–9% frame rate there and ~5% on open ground, because the costly draws
    (meadow batches, wind-displaced instanced trees and rocks) are not candidates.
    Shipped `enabled: false` with those numbers in the config comment.
    Note: this session overwrote an earlier, untracked port of these three files by
    another session (not recoverable); the rewrite was fitted to that session's
    tests (tests/gpuOcclusion.test.js), which pass.

- **2026-09-28 — minimap relief; the meadow trail confirmed on screen.**
  - The minimap was shaded by absolute altitude (1 + height × 0.025, clamped at
    1.25), so on Eldara — land hundreds of metres up — every pixel saturated to one
    brightness and the dial read as a flat biome disc. It now takes grass-test's
    relief (map/minimapRelief.js): land lit from the north-west by its slope (0.62
    shadowed … 1.12 lit), faint contours every 20 m, biome colours settled 18%
    toward their luminance, water flat. One height grid per redraw (192² plus a
    ring) replaces a height lookup per pixel.
  - Walking the meadow on harness keys stamped a trail into the interaction map and
    the grass behind the player lies folded as a lane. The fold recovers within a
    fraction of a second; the footprint flattening (groundDeformation) lasts the
    print's lifetime, so the lane fades rather than snapping back.
  - Full suite 2857/2857 after these changes.

- **2026-09-29 — look parity with the donor: sun, lens, meadow pigment, finish.**
  - *The sun was the gap.* Measured against the donor's meadow capture, our lit
    grass read (48,108,34) to its (136,169,93). The cause was not the grass: the
    configured sky stands the sun at 10°, so up-facing blades caught about a sixth
    of its light, and a 0.6 sky fill had been propping the field up. The donor's
    shipped look (`presets.goldenHour`) has its sun at ~57°. It is now the sky
    preset `meadow` (SkyPresets.js) and the default; `configured` is still in the
    Time menu, and a stored choice still wins. With it the field reads
    (128,169,50)/(141,175,69). A/B on chunk-cross (warmup 8, same session):
    78.2 fps / 26 hitches against 76.0 / 29 under `configured` — no cost.
  - *Meadow palette* (`grass.meadow.palette`): the donor's blade base `#50852b` and
    tip `#a6bf65`, live uniforms, falling back to the shared grass tuning when
    unset — the tuning's darker pair still paints the terrain and the clumps. The
    sky fill is back to the donor's 0.06.
  - *Lens*: `character.thirdPerson.fovDegrees: 45`, the donor's effective
    `camera.fov` (scene.yaml overrides config.yaml's 52); first person keeps 68. With
    the donor framing (distance, target, lift, shoulder in character heights) the
    hero now stands as large in frame as the donor's.
  - *Finish*: the donor's grade (saturation, contrast about 0.18, lift/gain,
    highlight desaturation, vignette, grain) and its bloom run on the walking view's
    god-rays pipeline (stylized/cinematicFinish.js), and the scene takes the donor's
    morning HDR as `scene.environment` (0.3) so armour and metals have something to
    reflect.
  - Note for measurement: the no-HMR dev server (watch off) serves cached
    transforms, so it must be restarted after every edit.
  - Full suite 2862/2862.

- **2026-09-29 — §11 item 8 wired: the deep-snow wake.** The staged
  `SnowWakeShading` now draws. `deformation/SnowWakeRecorder` lays the walking
  body's canonical position into the spine once a frame, with its heading (from
  the motion, so the banks lie across the path) and a smoothed ground speed; off
  the ground or in water a sample carries no profile, so a jump leaves a gap. The
  terrain applies it after the footprints (`stylizedSurface.snowWake.enabled`).
  - Two fixes on first sight, both in the shader. The triangular per-sample
    kernel dipped to half strength between samples and drew a dashed row; it is
    now full strength for half a step either side. And Eldara's canonical
    coordinates reach ~800 km, where float32 steps by 6 cm — the trench edges
    would stair-step — so samples are stored relative to a whole-metre anchor and
    the fragment is taken against it as whole-minus-whole, which is exact.
  - The 24-sample loop runs only on baked snow, with a trail that has moved, and
    inside a circle around the trail; everywhere else it is one compare. Verified
    on an Eldara glacier (a continuous banked trench behind a sprint, gone with the
    wake zeroed). chunk-cross A/B, warmup 8: 77.9 fps on, 74.4 off — noise.
  - Item 5 (trampling) is met by the meadow's interaction map for the default
    grass system; `stylized/trample/` stays staged for the clump system, which is
    no longer the default.

- **2026-09-29 — §11 items 6 and 4 landed; the meadow's palette per biome.**
  - *Item 6, the alpine conifers.* `prepare-alpine-tree-assets.mjs` had been fixed
    since it last failed, and only wanted the Draco decoder: `draco3dgltf` was
    copied from grass-test's own `node_modules` into ours (gitignored, not a
    declared dependency, as the script's header asks). tree10 (snow spruce) and
    tree11 (windswept pine) publish at 5 666 and 3 596 triangles (137 and 116 KiB)
    as `treeVariants` for taiga and tundra. Their crowns are painted per vertex —
    needles and settled snow in one leaf part — so the leaf material now takes
    COLOR_0 for an authored crown with no texture whose geometry carries it; every
    other authored crown has a map and is unchanged.
  - *A tree's pivot.* The windswept pine's crown streams ~3 m off its stem, and
    prototypes stand on the centre of their bounds, so its trunk capsule (read from
    the lowest trunk slice) sat metres off the placement — across a chunk border
    for a tree near one, which failed that chunk's whole collision build ("does not
    overlap its canonical owner chunk", 4 per taiga walk). A variant may now say
    `pivot: trunk` (StylizedTreePrototypes `pivotOnTrunkBase`: the centroid of the
    trunk's lowest tenth). Both alpine trees use it; 0 errors after. The default
    stays `bounds`, so no baked impostor or existing placement moves.
  - *Item 4, the tropical kit.* A layer of its own, as the config note said it
    had to be: `assets.tropicalKitVariants` (published and tiered like the other
    scatter keys, validated by the shared variant rules) and
    `stylizedSurface.tropicalKit`, a `StylizedGroundDetailView` streamed through
    residency with its own palette layer. The five members that publish cleanly
    (jungle grass short/tall/broad, groundcover, elephant ear) grow in tropical
    seasonal forest and rainforest, elephant ear in rainforest only. Authored
    0.4–1 m tall they vanished into the meadow blades, so they stand at ×1.4
    (×1.6 for the elephant ear). 128 candidates a chunk; chunk-cross A/B at the
    tropical spawn, warmup 8: 73.4 fps / 32 hitches on, 75.2 / 33 off. The other
    five members still need the per-asset optimizer pass; the heavy half (canopy
    tree, palms, large fern) stays offline.
  - *Meadow palette per biome* (`grass.meadow.palette.byTileId`). The donor's lime
    field was reaching the taiga. Each biome's palette index rides in the stem's
    look code beside its silhouette (`shape + 3 × palette`, meadowPalettes.js) and
    the pigment reads base and tip from a uniform array — no attribute, still one
    draw per band. Savanna dry, rainforests richer, taiga cool sage, wetland lush;
    the spawn's biome keeps the donor's own.
  - Full suite 2866/2866.

- **2026-09-29 — the donor's trees, its canopy grade, and the wind by chunk.**
  - *Trees.* grass-test's meadow trees (tree1–9: curved painted trunks, root
    flares, gold/pale/green leaf cards) are `treeVariants` now, prepared by
    `scripts/prepare-meadow-tree-assets.mjs` on helpers shared with the alpine
    preparer (`scripts/lib/donor-tree-prepare.mjs`; the alpine outputs are
    byte-identical after the split). Billboards stripped, bark UV transforms baked
    into TEXCOORD_0, branches decimated to 2 000 triangles, leaf cards thinned to
    3 000 by dropping whole cards and growing the survivors ×≤1.6 about their
    centres (simplifying alpha cards collapses them). ~5 k triangles a tree, from
    12–22 k. Donor units convert at 2.8/m (`scale: 0.357`, alpine pair too), which
    keeps the donor's tree-to-character proportions. Green for savanna→tropics,
    gold for deciduous, pale for grassland/temperate rainforest/wetland; the oak
    keeps the savanna and the tree-scene crowns the rainforests and wetland.
    `pivot: trunk` on all of them. Impostors rebaked (29 prototypes).
  - *Canopy grade* (`trees.canopyGrade`, forest/canopyGrade.js): the donor's
    `adventureCanopyColor` — textured authored crowns re-coloured by luminance onto
    one shade→light green ramp (`#286746`→`#8cb75a`, 0.9). It is why every donor
    crown reads as the same lit green. `autumnGroves` 0.55 → 0.1: half the spawn's
    woods were orange against it.
  - *Jungle region.* Tropical seasonal forest (5) is open woodland, not the donor's
    rainforest; it was taking full jungle mist and spores and washing the spawn's
    distance milky. The ambient jungle region is rainforest (7) only; 5 is meadow.
  - *Cost.* chunk-cross A/B at the spawn: 59.5 fps with the trees, 69.4 without
    (−14%; hitches 39 vs 38). Whole cards had cost −34% (40 vs 60). A further cut to
    3.4 k triangles changed nothing (60.4), so the remainder is not triangles —
    candidates are the extra prototypes' draws and the near ring's shadow pass.
  - *Wind by chunk — two causes.* (1) Every wind wave took its phase as
    `dot(canonical, localFieldDirection)`. On a planet-scale map canonical
    positions are hundreds of km, so a milliradian of field curl moves the phase by
    hundreds of metres and neighbouring patches fall onto unrelated waves. Phases
    now run along the prevailing direction (`windWaveCoordinates`, worldWindState):
    meadow blades, gust sheen, far cards, flowers, clump grass, blown streaks. The
    local field still sets bend direction and gust strength. (2) The authored ground
    tufts (and the tropical kit) had no wind at all; their density is weighted per
    chunk and district, so whole patches stood rigid in a swaying sward. They now
    bend with the meadow's own wave, clock and field (groundDetailWind.js); water
    plants keep their current-driven sway.
  - Boot note: shader compile on this machine is ~95–120 s today, over qa:perf's
    108 s default budget. Pass `--timeoutMs 400000`.
  - Full suite 2869/2869.

- **2026-09-29 — why the shaders took so much longer than the donor's.**
  - Measured cold (fresh Playwright profile, same GPU): the donor boots in 60 s,
    41 s of it pipeline warmup. Ours took ~74–140 s. Split by step, it was the
    world scene, not spells (3.6 s) or the hero (0.3 s): 62 s.
  - Pipeline inventory: we compile *fewer* pipelines than the donor (300 vs 1394),
    but 12.5 MB of fragment WGSL against 3.2 MB, and our largest shader was
    3.2 MB (three terrain variants) against the donor's 146 KB — with 484 texture
    samples, where the design has 8 family-atlas taps.
  - Cause: TSL emits `select()` as an if/else and builds each branch's inputs
    inside it. Nested selects — the stochastic sampler's rotation/mirror, the
    top/side projection, then the baked colour's four distance bands and three
    publish-state selects — re-emitted the family multiplier ~36× and `midColor`
    ~18×. Operands are now taken into variables inside an `Fn` before the selects
    (TerrainMaterialStochasticNodes, TerrainMaterialBakedNodes
    `assembleBakedColor`); the selects, and their runtime branching, are unchanged.
  - Result: terrain fragment shader 3.2 MB → 252 KB, 484 → 32 texture samples;
    world compile 62 s → 9 s; first frame 74 s → 17 s. And at runtime, chunk-cross
    with the donor trees: 59.5 → 68.4 fps, hitches 39 → 28.
  - Still open: a value-noise helper inlined ~72× in the terrain — an
    `Fn(...).setLayout()` would emit it once.

- **2026-09-29 — the donor's paths, stones and river water.**
  - *Paths* (stylized/path/terrainPathPaint.js, `stylizedSurface.path.paint`):
    the donor's `GroundMaterial` path look over the baked terrain — its
    `ground_0109` dirt with the donor's two-tap anti-tiling, pulled 48% toward
    `groundPath` `#b7a476`, the contour broken by its turf fibres and macro wave,
    the verge painted as worn turf, soil roughness. The dirt tiles a whole number of
    times per chunk and the noise runs on chunk-local metres wrapped every 1 km, so
    both stay exact at planet scale. It runs only where the path mask or verge
    exceeds 0.03: unbranched it cost 53 vs 77 fps on chunk-cross. Branched, runs
    scattered 54–78 fps on the same code today (no-paint runs 71–77), so the
    remaining cost is below this machine's noise.
  - *Samplers.* The terrain's fragment stage already used all 16 samplers WebGPU
    allows, and three binds one for every filterable texture however it is read.
    The dirt's roughness is packed into its colour texture's alpha (one texture),
    and the macro-tint bake is now read by hand-filtered `textureLoad` from a
    nearest-filtered texture (TerrainSlotBindings.bilinearLoad), which frees one.
  - *Stones.* grass-test's eleven `SM_Rocks` stones (fantasy/rocks.glb, prepared by
    scripts/prepare-donor-rock-assets.mjs: Draco decoded, painted-stone texture
    embedded) replace the mixed rock set at the donor's ×7 pack scale (2.5 m here);
    the former entries are kept commented in `rockVariants`. The meadow now leaves
    only `rocks.grassClearance` (0.35) of a stone's spacing radius bare, so grass
    grows up to the stone as in the donor instead of round a pale 1.8 m disc.
  - *River water.* config/water-visual.yaml takes the donor's inland constants:
    teal `#246d70`/`#164e52`, its absorption (0.62/0.24/0.17 per metre), its foam
    colour `#d6e7db`, no cell pattern and no caustics. Still open: its flow-mapped
    detail normals, sun glint and shore/bank foam placement. Eldara has no brook at
    the donor's scale (every river ≥ 6 m deep), and long teleports in walk mode stall
    on "Preparing the ground… 1 chunk left" at 0 fps, so a river close-up could not
    yet be verified on screen.
  - Full suite 2869/2869.

- **2026-09-30 — the donor's river surface.**
  - *Port* (stylized/RiverSurfaceShading.js, `stylizedSurface.water.riverSurface`):
    grass-test's `WaterMaterial` inland branch on our water sheet — its
    `createWaterDetailTexture` verbatim; two detail phases half a cycle apart,
    cross-faded (`|2·phase − 1|`) plus its micro layer; slopes 0.15 lake / 0.16
    river / 0.025 micro turned into the across/downstream frame of the current;
    its Fresnel `(1 − n·v)^5 · 0.98 + 0.02`, weighted 0.85 and damped on a fall
    face; its glint `pow(spec, 170) · 1.8 + pow(spec, 20) · 0.08`, added after the
    sky dimming in the sun's own colour (`skyLightUniforms.sunColor`, new); and its
    foam — noise foam in the 0.02–0.75 m shallows, a bank fringe over
    `bankFoamWidth`, turbulence streaks `(speed − 0.7) · 0.34` once the current runs.
    It replaces our shore and flow-band foam on inland water; the sea keeps its
    own swell shading (`SeaSurfaceShading` now exposes its `mask`).
  - *What had to change.* The donor's rivers are ribbons with metres along and
    across their course, and scroll the detail down that course. Our sheet is the
    terrain grid with a flow texture and no course coordinates, so the phases are
    advected along the local current instead (a flow map: `cycleSeconds` 3,
    `stillDrift` 0.07 m/s — the donor's lake — and `currentDrift` 1.2 m/s at full
    current). The detail is isotropic at 4 m a tile (donor lake 5.5 m, river
    1.6 × 8 m), micro ×4 (donor ×3.7) and streaks ×1.5, all whole numbers of a
    320 m period, and the chunk centre is wrapped to that period in double
    precision (`riverDetailPatternOrigin`), so the coordinates stay exact at
    planet scale and the wrap never shows. The donor's world is 2.8 units to the
    metre: spatial scales are converted, its shading constants are not, and its
    foam depth band is read in metres. The donor reflects a cube probe of its own
    banks; we have none, so the Fresnel mixes toward its own fallback sky
    (`#81a8b4` → `#38658a`). Against a bright sky rather than a tree line its
    slopes read about twice as strong, so `normalStrength` is 0.5.
  - *Budget.* Water fragment shaders are 44–56 KB with 5–6 samplers (one more:
    the shared detail texture). No viewport-texture nodes were added. The largest
    shader is still the terrain's, 268 KB and 16 samplers.
  - *Verified on screen* on an Eldara river (cell −2094883, −350032, temperate
    rainforest), from its bank: fine glitter on the current, foam along the
    shallows. Still visible and not from this change: the carved valley walls
    between grass and river render as a flat blue-grey band (also in the
    2026-09-29 capture).

- **2026-09-30 — the "Preparing the ground… 1 chunk left" stall.** Not a hang: after
  a long teleport into forest the page ran at 0.2–0.8 fps for 165 s, then
  recovered, and collision readiness only waited on it. A CPU profile of those
  frames put 95% of the main thread in `MacroFarTerrainView.sampleRing` →
  `ForestHabitatField.sample` → `waterDistanceAt` → `TileDistanceField.chunkField`:
  every far-ring sample (160 × 256 of them, hundreds of metres apart) lands in a
  different chunk and built that chunk's whole water chamfer field through
  `tileAt`. The far backdrop now takes `ForestHabitatField.sampleCoarse`, the same
  habitat without the water terms (neutral water weight, no riparian belt — a belt
  tens of metres wide that its ring spacing cannot resolve anyway) and without
  touching the near field's sample cache. Same teleport: 165 s → 18 s to 45 fps,
  the rest ordinary streaming. chunk-cross (warmup 8, two runs each) barely moves,
  as expected for a scenario that never rebuilds the far ring over forest:
  88.6 / 94.2 fps and 10 / 9 hitches with the fix, 88.7 / 88.9 fps and 13 / 12
  without. Both are well above the 68 fps recorded on 2026-09-29, a difference
  this change does not explain.

- **2026-09-30 — pebbles, duff and contact shade, stones.**
  - *Path pebbles.* grass-test strews its rock pack's pebble shapes (`SM_Rocks_06/07/
    10/11`) along its paths from `MeadowDetails`, at their native size — only its
    boulders take the ×7 pack scale. They are extracted as `donor-rock-pebbles`
    (pebble-01..04, 54–56 triangles, 64 KB each after the runtime optimizer) and
    placed as ground detail on paths only: tile 13 joined `groundDetails.tileIds`
    at `densityByTile` 0.4, the donor's ~1 stone per 170 m² of path; scale 2.5 / 7,
    so 6–26 cm stones. A new variant flag `sway: false` keeps them out of the wind.
    `extract-authored-assets.mjs --only <key>` now merges into the manifest instead
    of replacing it with that one source. Measured in place: 11 pebbles on the 314
    path cells of the test chunk. At walking distance they barely register — as
    small and sparse as the donor's — and on path-edge cells the meadow hides them.
  - *Contact shade and duff.* The forest-floor texture is 64² (2 m texels, was 16²
    at 8 m), so the donor's footprints fit at trunk scale: `3 + 1.2·scale` m round
    a trunk (its `trunk·3 + 3`), `1 + 1.2·scale` round a stone (`radius·1.5 + 1`),
    strengths 1 / 0.8. The canopy keeps its 16 × 16 habitat samples, upsampled
    bilinearly (stylized/forestFloorTexture.js), so the main-thread cost is
    unchanged. The ground under a patch takes the donor's duff — `mix(dull·0.45,
    pathPaint·(0.42, 0.35, 0.26), 0.5)`, then `×(1 − 0.4·smoothstep(0.1, 0.6))` —
    in place of the flat 0.45 darkening (`contactShade.depth` is gone). Visible as
    a brown litter patch on bare ground; under the meadow it is hidden, because our
    grass grows to the trunk where the donor's clears round it.
  - *Stones.* River-bank stones already draw from the rock view's own prototypes
    (`buildRiverbankRocks` → `prototypeIndexForRoll`), so they took the donor pack
    with yesterday's swap. `rockWeathering` had read the donor's tone and moss
    frequencies per metre, where they are per donor unit: a 2.5 m stone got one flat
    tone and either no moss or a solid cap. Now converted (×2.8).
  - *Open: donor-pack stones do not appear on screen.* Close-up comparison was
    blocked. A placed boulder (`SM_Rocks_04`, 6 m at scale 1.32) is in the manifest,
    its instance matrix is correct (0.11 m from the placement, root offset
    current), its instanced mesh is submitted ~230 times a second, and it is not
    frustum-culled, dithered out (fade 1) or hidden by GPU occlusion (switched off
    at runtime: no change). With its material swapped for a plain red one it is
    still invisible — while a plain `Mesh` of the same geometry and material placed
    6 m away draws. So the geometry and material are fine and the instanced draw
    is not; last session's river captures never showed a donor stone either (they
    stalled), so this may date from the pack swap. Next: compare the GPU-side
    instance buffer with the CPU array, and try a rock instance near the origin.
  - *Flaky tests.* ConstructionMortarVoidWiring, ConstructionOpenings and
    ConstructionLodTransitionAccounting: 0 failures in 25 isolated runs each and in
    5 full-suite runs. Nothing in their build path is time-gated — `budget` is a
    stone count and the `performance.now()` calls only fill stats. Most likely the
    single failures came from files being rewritten mid-run by another session
    (the construction `*.generated.js` configs are modified in this tree); not
    proven.
  - *Perf* (chunk-cross, warmup 8, final code): 93.9 / 93.3 fps, hitches 6 / 10,
    against 88.6 / 94.2 and 10 / 9 this morning. Full suite 2906/2906.

- **2026-09-30 — review of the paths/stones/rivers round.**
  - *The "donor stones don't draw" blocker was a false negative.* At the spawn all
    eleven `SM_Rocks` prototypes have valid geometry (57–860 vertices, position,
    normal and uv only — well under the vertex-buffer ceiling) and draw 38–68
    instances each; the tall slab is on screen beside the spawn. The Eldara spot
    where it looked invisible most likely showed a buried or proxy-band stone.
  - *Ground-detail wind:* the tuft height is now a uniform. Baked in as a
    constant, every prototype's shader text differed and each compiled its own
    pipeline (4 fewer vertex programs at the spawn, more as variants stream).
  - Reviewed and kept: RiverSurfaceShading (phase cross-fade weights hit zero on
    each wrap; the 320 m pattern period divides every tile), the far-terrain
    `sampleCoarse` (water weight is neutral at infinite distance), the `--only`
    manifest merge, the 2 m forest-floor texels on the 128 m chunk, the duff.
  - Full suite 2907/2907.
  - *Follow-ups from the review:*
    - Rock weathering reads the stone's own geometry shifted by its placement
      seed (`instanceDither.y`) instead of render-space position, so tone, moss
      and the splash line no longer jump on a floating-origin rebase.
    - River foam has its own `riverSurface.foamStrength` (1); `foam.intensity`
      stays the sea bands' knob.
    - The snow wake reads the body through `PlayerController.readFooting` into
      reused objects instead of a `getStatus()` copy every frame.
    - A water config without `riverSurface` loads with the surface off.
    - Checked and left alone: pebbles do reach imported worlds (the generator
      returns the path tile wherever a graded trail covers a cell), and the river
      sky already follows the look through `reflectionTint`.
    - Full suite 2907/2907; the stone renders with no shader errors.

- **2026-09-30 — review pass over the day's port.**
  - *The donor stones were never drawn.* A placed boulder's matrices were right on
    the CPU, and a fresh `InstancedMesh` with the same geometry, material,
    matrices and capacity drew — only the scatter's own mesh stayed empty until
    its buffer was forced to re-upload. Past the uniform limit (~1000 matrices)
    three wraps `instanceMatrix` in an interleaved vertex buffer with one set of
    views per material build; a view created after a partial write records the
    buffer as current and never uploads it, so a material rebuild landing
    between our write and the next draw strands the instances on their creation
    values. `createInstancedRenderers` now gives every scatter mesh a
    `StorageInstancedBufferAttribute`: one binding, one version, every tracked
    range uploaded. It covers rocks, bushes, trees and ground detail alike.
  - *Small scatter collapsed at planet scale.* Instance matrices held canonical
    positions (x ≈ −4 188 269, where float32 steps by 0.25 m), and the GPU applies
    them before the root's offset, so a 10 cm pebble drew as a sliver and every
    trunk and boulder was snapped to that grid. Rocks, bushes, trees and ground
    detail now write instances relative to an `InstanceAnchor` (the floating
    origin at a rewrite, moved only after 2 km of drift) with the root at
    anchor − origin. The same change compares matrices as float32: against the
    float64 source nearly every element differed, so each rebuild re-uploaded
    every instance. chunk-cross (warmup 8, four runs): 98.1 / 87.8 / 96.5 /
    95.6 fps against 93.9 / 93.3, hitches 10 / 14 / 12 / 9 against 6 / 10 (today's
    runs span 6–14), attribute uploads 12 MB against 36 MB a run.
  - *Far ring.* The backdrop's forest signal moved into its shading pass and now
    reads the ring's own macro tile, height and slope
    (`ForestHabitatField.sampleCoarse(x, z, terrain)`), where each sample had cost
    five fine-terrain height queries through the water-terrain model: 11.1 s →
    5.3 s of main thread over the same 40 s after a long teleport. What remains is
    mostly `GeneratorWaterAdapter.sampleMacroColumn` carving lakes and rivers into
    the macro heights through a second water model.
  - *Pebbles.* One `pebbles.glb` of four prototype groups with a 256 px texture
    (27 KB, was four files of 64 KB), placed by a new `path-interior` rule
    (StrategicDetailPlacement) that keeps them off a path's edge cells, where the
    meadow hid them.
  - *Water.* River foam follows the tier's `foamStrength`; the sea keeps its own
    shading when its swell is off (`seaWaterMask`, which the swell now uses too);
    the river detail origin is a `riverDetail` frame of the water's
    PatternOrigins (committed alongside by the planet-scale water work) instead of
    a uniform and wrap of its own.
  - *Config.* `contactShade` sat under `stylizedSurface.trees`, where nothing read
    it; it is now `stylizedSurface.contactShade`.
  - Still open: `rockWeathering` reads `positionWorld`, so its tone and moss
    pattern jumps on every floating-origin rebase (left to the planet-scale
    pattern work); `ForestHabitatField` and the far ring still hold other
    per-sample costs worth profiling. Full suite 2920/2920.
